		<p style="text-align:right">March 24, 2011</p>

<p>
traveling incognito <br>
north by train <br>
followed the river side, the alluvial plain <br>
washed by trauma<br>
this cannot help but scream <br>
see your sneaky streak and lie<br>
reveal your secrets <br>
betray one another cry intermittently live <br>
listen listen skim dig that delicious enterprise <br>
hokey pokey general propositions rattled by trains lost on businesses <br>
the river winds oh<br>
the river winds<br>
pass heritage by <br>
my dear friends<br>
what night will take us<br>
who is connected and is silent to<br>
who protects the best of our cohort<br>
lakes and dark nights<br>
who for years was the guardian <br>
what power I gain  I hold<br>
oh natural phenomena begin <br>
bring others who make shine you 
you and I we were the explorers how you guided me </p><br>

<p>
- the one thing I turned to as all  my mind turned white <br>
who has begun to hallucinate monsters on the floor crawling music at command now <br>
use words correctly and be fluent in them, <br>
my lover: know my life transformed me  and yet years pass by, I am the same, I ride the same train </p><br>

<br>
<p>
I have been transformed trained myself <br>
I am saving my strength for a great fight for the boarders of our land will need<br>
protection soon. <br>
I want to start out once again <br>
the future will be better and still we may not be on the right path now</p><br>

<p>
who lets coffee grinds become a source of knowledge<br>
which concepts have not given up to manipulation <br>
which concepts remain fixed,  love? even I do not understand <br>
how to give a coherent account of it <br>
I guess we will always come back to realizing that our language is something which is  ambiguous<br>
-not the operations of our thoughts which lead us to dilemma.<br>
- the dilemma is that words hinder some processes, are illusory, </p><br>

<p>
I don't believe I am a person in at least two respects. <br>
I don't think I am coherent nor am afforded the rights of persons, <br> 
I don't believe words have absolute meaning, I do know being and this being is what I am talking about and to<br>
experience being is with what I now suffer<br>
what I desire, to be with and for now am without<br>
- have mad elaborate fantasies to remove myself from pain of life<br>
seen smiles that weren't there <br>
the meaning I see it in your eyes and am wrong, read it into you incorrectly</p><br>

<p>
to be so wrong about something with such delight <br>
to drag something through the mud and exclaim it’s all right it’s meant for that</p><br>

<p>
to burn to look back on and laugh <br>
to contact and raise to your communicative awareness</p><br>

<p>
there is this other place for you and that world may be <br>
and though the architecture may not slip down nor just hang in the air <br>
the hot surfaces shimmer and vibrate and move around the room<br>
- people get off the train yet I don't feel lost without them, my brain must be working correctly </p><br>

<br>
<p>
my lover you are for me a source for I have felt from love hurt and pain I have fallen <br>
what life gave to us was this place</p><br>

<p>
who while feel over every turn and curve in your life and not just listen with ears no.<br>
who shares the capacity for understanding<br>
housed the thoughts of others so clearly <br>
who used thirty million little pixels to do their bidding<br>
- the symbolic elements were under your fingertips<br>
- those elements became electric set as stone by fire<br>
- how do you remember this all will you remember<br>
it's just a step back to the computer<br>
-  &nbsp;no number is ever lost but yours I cannot find <br>
- mine I got disconnected <br>
for all those times I lost my phone and felt so lost <br>
after feeling lost I just gave up that thing  it never helped me find but only did so represent that which is <br>
and there is what I find <br>
the trees, as they climb up the hill from floodplain to flood plane, grow old there<br>
uniformed liked soldiered lines</p><br>

<p>
my lover<br>
I will protect you  </p><br>

<p>
that is the first thing my love will do for you<br>
I will shield you cloak you be in love </p><br>

<p>
how come you're down on your knees<br>
how come you can't get up on your feet<br>
I just tried to get up early and make the morning something</p><br>

<p>
make your motion<br>
pour your gasoline right on the road<br>
and fill your tank again<br>
you won't hear that one from me again <br>
no.<br>
you look like you're afraid but you're just alone</p><br>

<p>
little timing takes the motion drives them home </p><br>

<p>
list of things to take: <br>
trash, cloths from the floor, all my thoughts of you.<br>
you and I cool down <br>
as they heat up<br>
it comes to you in a dream like that the phenomenal experience <br>
that is your life <br>
what i mean you get of it <br>
there it is there <br>
there it is there<br>
you saw the weather change and you were like that. <br>
so what-<br>
&nbsp; where was you heart when you we slipping and falling <br>
how can I make love to myself if you're too restrictive with your definition of it, my love<br>
somethings coming <br>
somethings coming <br>
you'll never turn to it again, <br>
it’s just a dream. <br>
not fearing the dark dark forest</p><br>

<p>
who knows but the same ways home </p><br>

<p>
reflections can be broken <br>
high places in green mountains <br>
cold springs <br>
and feel removed from it all<br>
to feel absolutely the same for so long<br>
like our habits played for us <br>
the only thing that changes in it is our language</p><br>

<p>
with its mysteries and confusions <br>
childhood and start a new life<br>
outreach capture when your hand<br>
lay or fall yourself to sleep<br>
rest light into the night go quietly </p><br>

<p>
and it falls apart at the seems from many things<br>
any you're there<br>
your a million little pieces and<br>
how come you're down on your knees<br>
how come you can't get up on your feet<br>
I just tried to get up early and make the morning something</p><br>
