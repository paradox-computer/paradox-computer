<p>
My hand,  I hold you in the air and so wave fortune.<br>
Be not out of grasp, my fortune!<br>
Shimmer mirage of image there-<br>
Set forth by more than what I constitute-<br>
fortune you can no longer be a ghost<br>
You can respond to me<br>
I wave my hand as to command you<br>
Fortune I am here. </p><br>

<p>
How can it be that you take the form of my dreams but I cannot take you to my life?<br>
I devoid myself of sleep to catch you awake<br>
The air will shimmer<br>
sometimes it does crackle like electricity<br>
flash and flicked <br>
Yet never fortune throw you to me</p><br>

<p>
My ears will not ever stop to listen,<br>
for that when fortune drop you <br>
the air will carry;<br>
the ground will stop you<br>
in explosion so fortunate enough that I may hear.</p><br>

<p>
Understand my superstition lays untouched to my philosophy<br>
my mind holds one while my gestures signify another.<br>
Those are the movements that now and others someday will transcend us.</p><br>

<p>
Touched by superstition <br>
decayed by madness <br>
this is the beginning.</p><br>

<p>
Let me use my metaphysics <br>
my rhymes and riddles won't convey this<br>
to en-graven with your likeness<br>
A sense that’s growing stronger <br>
so to constitute you<br>
I call you to existence </p><br>

<p>
I can incant you<br>
If I find you<br>
before I die, to make the gestures<br>
You will break apart the world<br>
You are the water<br>
And so I be your night<br>
and you be daylight<br>
I will past, your future<br>
I fast and pray in your honor <br>
If you so shower me and enlighten the world</p><br>

<p>
Will you yield to me this night, Oh Fortune?<br>
You have the power to incarnate, to maintain them<br>
if I lay the symbols in the sand</p><br>

<p>
My Fortune do you hear me?<br>
I call upon the one I love...</p><br>

<p>
The heart that beats in me <br>
I can not help it;<br>
and my prayers are not to gods but to you<br>
My superstition is you<br>
My philosophy and heart beat sing for you <br>
the listener who I imagine;<br>
Your whispers captivate me- <br>
like unwinding rhymes and rhythms  <br>
a slow percussion as every word is folding <br>
and every line and syllable <br>
will wash away all fear</p><br>

<p>
I cannot help but wonder why each day each tide of souls that passes <br>
By whose fortune does bring them, if not our fortune-?<br>
Of whom I speak freely of and do not fear cold destiny <br>
Stop my heart or clot my blood, destroy my brain and I will be in no less harmony <br>
Not ever less than this moment can I ever be</p><br>

<p>
-Be it a wiser majesty, my own fortune,<br>
will be realized by my spoken words<br><br>
by breath and in here and now</p><br>

<p>
Fortune make it be not longer <br>
Say they have forgotten already <br>
they have forsaken always<br>
the coolness of the waters<br>
And I can not even but myself bring <br>
the hand to tears nor calm the storm- <br>
-electricity beyond the horizon</p><br>

<p>
Fortune stop spinning!<br>
realize the material to listen<br>
be that spoken air transcend us<br>
cleans blood and flesh with clean waters</p><br>

<p>
Manifest by fortune, secured by fate<br>
Like gravity, the sun<br>
Manifest the philosophy to stop for a moment, <br>
the sun; so we can transition <br>
from fortune's darkness into the light <br>
I will be in darkness until I join you in the next life<br>
I fear the darkness now will not make it to the next age<br>
I worry not if life persist but I worry I will miss this world<br>
Here and now and this moment<br>
it could be as I cast symbols <br>
Only to now wait and see <br>
the sun will illuminate them<br>
and fill the depth that I engraved them</p><br>

<p>
O’ fortune I say the measurements are perfect<br>
the last drop to the brim<br>
which I dare say was my own tear<br>
It can be that this world falls in fortune’s light<br>
and still not interrupt the next mortal life</p><br>

<p>
So, but revision philosophy now and in perfect balance<br>
lay the future, not disrupt it<br>
Be not where the future lay now!<br>
I can see it <br>
You, fortune, are the future<br>
I can lay open for you the awful past</p><br>

<p>
Fortune you set this world into motion<br>
I once thought I did control your manifest<br>
your mandate I may have never to possess<br>
In habituate the darkness; I confess to you<br>
Lake waters, far off stars, predicates of the mind<br>
You speak to me, fortunes spins and my hands tremble<br>
The voices scream and my vision moves like life intoxicates me</p><br>

<p>
The matter of my bones are dust when enlightened<br>
you can stand dust and ashes<br>
as you, the light, blows them away<br>
And so I will be at fortune’s darkest moment, flesh?<br>
With the glyphs drawn in the sand to see you<br>
This come rising morning<br>
From whence I will rise un-slept <br>
to carry out a lifetime <br>
to find you manifest in symbols<br>
or in flesh and in the light </p><br>

<p>
I know my thoughts and prayers do reach to you <br>
for all that you are I know<br>
You’re there, you curve and bent the time and space <br>
All our matter orbits around the moment your light rises<br>
and is raining</p><br>

<p>
Let light be admits the air today and not against it<br>
let me thrive the darkness or so expose me<br><br>
End the past now so the prophecy has ended<br>
before the need of it does end-<br>
End it, the need<br>
Take my flesh to do it<br>
but do not just let darkness juxtapose <br>
the dark past.</p><br>

<p>
Fill the air with light, sun!<br>
Show my skin is just the philosophy I make it to be<br>
The sweet taste on my lips<br>
The impression of death<br>
Be it all those things I take it to be<br>
realized by archaic rituals you will be<br>
and somewhere far off, so will realize another</p><br>

<p>
Come so to transcend us light and break apart the world<br>
Here and now so many do away you; They need not to forget<br>
Through the darkness they can see not to know<br>
Fortune cannot but hardly sound to those who careful listen<br>
My loudest yells are echoes to you</p><br>

<p>
Fortune- Do not let this time slip<br>
I cannot command you not to <br>
Let go!<br>
Let break apart what may <br>
and in the last minute lay philosophy in pieces<br>
and so to all the world revision</p><br>

<p>
Hand I waver, touch the air before me <br>
the gestures will follow through the air to reach you</p><br>
