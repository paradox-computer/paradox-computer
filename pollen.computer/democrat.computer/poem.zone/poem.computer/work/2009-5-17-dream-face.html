<p>
How awful it was to dream <br>
How awful lonely daylight morning all alone<br>
and still dreaming <br>
my dreams feel like lies</p><br>
<p>
Faces and eyes in trees and in sky<br>
faces on tree trunks on rock walls and sidewalks<br>
Are they the same faces they haunt me at night?<br>
they are the haunted - they have no life <br>
nothing like what we give them.  <br>
nothing too good <br>
nothing too bad <br>
all of those other lives you pictured you had<br>
How they haunt you?</p><br>
<p>
the poetry can be different <br>
[the lives can be] <br>
my perceptions contradict my dreams <br>
my memories happened <br>
while my dreams happen also<br>
where my dreams have been-<br>
will my memories follow?</p><br>
<p>
My dreams, how you speak to me <br>
you haunt and hang where my conscious is not <br>
all lofty places my mind cannot stand to be <br>
Flies out, dries own, wakes up.<br>
I had never conceived that my dreams would make me<br>
deceive myself, wish that I hadn't, because those dreams, <br>
nothing will be like them.  </p><br>
