<p>
Something here is going down<br>
but you're not here to feel it happening:</p><br>

<p>
You are in the cities <br>
The roads go far, they stretch to where you are<br>
As you travel I will fast and pray but that will not do</p><br>

<p>
On two other continents, far from here are- our friends<br>
and they are coming back soon-<br>
Will you be here to meet them?<br>
they will have changed and we change and there are some new faces</p><br>

<p>
So, let's face it we can't go back as if to stop time a year ago<br>
this trip 30 years from now will be just a memory<br>
unless you remember too<br>
unless you come back <br>
come back <br>
find me here<br>
I will have you before I leave this town<br>
I will know where you are and 30 years from now this will be a memory of ours</p><br>

<p>
this will be like some simple dream<br>
you and I -meeting<br>
thirty years looking back having had a good life</p><br>
