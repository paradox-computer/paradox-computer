<p>
So many memories are now only mine<br>
So many people, they no longer are amidst the house-<br>
that-saddens me for the new faces have no reason to remember </p><br>
<p>
I do not wish to consecrate them <br>
Why are they not here?<br>
and, so they tackle me in my dreams <br>
and I remember and long to be<br>
taken back in time to once again be with them<br>
for one more warm summer, <br>
one more evening <br>
one more time on the lawn <br>
where and when the parties were lit with torches<br>
the mulchen ground turned to stone<br>
where on warm evenings the dark-night became a best friend<br>
where the spiders hung from the walls and dropped from the ceilings<br>
for the lights-were always on <br>
the road sign was as big as it could be<br>
the boats could wash away or sink but never were going anywhere<br>
at the Marina  </p><br>
<p>
Funeral parties, wedding parties, search and rescue parties; and the regatta of boats-<br> 
ladybugs and green sea-monsters- shipwrecks and the sinking of the ‘belle from hell’<br>
Remember that it was not always like-this<br>
or just remember the roses <br>
giant bushes- pieces of which still survive - somewhere else<br>
skeletons of once did stand there still <br>
while passing days turns pages<br>
where we make our reservations<br>
and the computer has us all there<br>
anyone could come back, pop in and aloha she still works<br>
and remembers <br>
How the silent glass rooms haunt me at night<br>
How it feels strange to be alone there <br>
as if the air and dust still did vibrate <br>
-was infused with echoes <br>
-roaring laughter to the ear<br>
-with the interspersed shrill cackle<br>
some screams, shrieks and cries </p><br>
<p>
It did seem like the walls would crumble from the outside,<br>
as if the duck would into the river fly<br>
the big white goose only exists now in memories <br>
off ski jumps in big balloon heated tents<br>
garlic festival, garlic brownies, garlic wine<br>
how the relics in the attic and the photos in the office <br>
haunt my mind </p><br>
<p>
We could simply float the house like a boat<br>
we could take her down the rivers-<br>
to warm weather in the winter- <br>
so we can rock and roll all night <br>
we can land and pick up <br>
who we miss now <br>
on our way there. <br>
Come now, we are open lunch and laugh, launch your boat here <br>
guest dock, fly in, tie up<br>
the wind may rock you<br>
the atmosphere may shock you<br>
exactly like this- is no other kind</p><br>
<p>
Some day when will wake and life be different<br>
-Does this mean that our dreams will be?<br>
All the people who chose to leave-<br>
For not of need of shelter nor food<br>
they packed their bags and flapped their wings'<br>
 and off into the night breeze flew -[were they longing to be different] <br>
Did they chose to be?</p><br>
<p>
Their names are only words I speak <br>
Or, were they always only words?<br>
So, but I miss their touch that fades into dark pain<br>
The empathy I feel <br>
And for each other and in-between there are more than simple names for things <br>
and others unsaid<br>
others dead and buried,<br>
ashes or invalid <br>
or grown into something different </p><br>
