		<p style="text-align:right">March 5th, 2009</p>



<p>
When I think about you I feel happiness-<br>
It’s like a light on, to show me your face<br>
for a moment I am suspended</p><br>

<p>
This is not the way I suspected it would go<br>
For me it did seem you would- burst through the door<br>
or was it a dream?<br>
When I close my eyes and fall<br>
you’re not here to sleep</p><br>

<p>
Running fingers through your hair<br>
&nbsp; -feeling the texture of defeat<br>
you swore the ring you'd wear and would keep</p><br>

<p>
I needed you to take your shoes off<br>
and walk into the lake<br>
when the fires came I called your name<br>
&nbsp; -but I missed you</p><br>

<p>
Now I leisure, smoke, my days<br>
you're the ashes blow away-<br>
All you are is ashes when I die<br>
as I exhale your memories one last time.</p><br>
