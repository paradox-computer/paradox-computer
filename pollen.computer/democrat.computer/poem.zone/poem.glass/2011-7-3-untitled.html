<p>
thought that fair may work and she may come back <br>
who busted down walls <br>
broke glasses on the ground <br>
speaking of ourselves with as if we were storms as if we were peaceful days as if we were atmospheres wherein larger natural<br> bodies take their place </p><br>

<p>
enlightened sky in the morning dawn <br>
enlightened sheer surfaces by moonlight <br>
enlightened faces and distant objects lit by lightning</p><br>
