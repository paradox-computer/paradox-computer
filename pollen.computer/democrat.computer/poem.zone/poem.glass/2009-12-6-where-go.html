<p>
by where comes?<br>
by road or air?<br>
by railway?<br>
be the waters that will take you back?<br>
or the woods do carry you away?</p><br>

<p>
The electric lines do you justice-?<br>
nor do the word of mouth that over I distribute myself <br>
Under those electric lines <br>
they cut the forest down to make them<br>
and they span across the mountain ranges<br>
clear the air for wired lines- and broadcasts <br>
bouncing all around</p><br>

<p>
When someday soon come turning round<br>
no tornado<br>
no roots to fall and trip over<br>
no harvest from the land<br>
bare fields by lonely roads<br>
dirty city streets<br>
where the agony<br>
&nbsp; that brought them there<br>
-can be forgotten? </p><br>

<p>
Where did it go?<br>
our haunted lonely sorrow <br>
they us here to cities, detached <br>
from the land that suffocates under <br>
and tendrils spring from every crack of</p><br>

<p>
And you, whose movements are<br>
in perfect measure to <br>
reverberate in arriving here in this place<br>
A world I never have left</p><br>
