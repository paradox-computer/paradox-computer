		<h2 class="select">BEFORE I FORGET</h2>&nbsp;
		<p style="text-align:right">December 12, 2015</p>

<p>
Before it's all over....<br>
before that last tear drop falls...<br>
before my heart lays cold like a rock within my breast<br>
and does not jump at the sight of you...<br>
like it once did,</p><br>

<p>
I want you to know...<br>
there was a time when all I thought about ...was you,<br>
when days and nights...blended together<br>
to form one long ribbon of fantasies.<br>
When your touch...could comfort me...<br>
and excite me...at the same time<br>
When just one soft look...<br>
or crooked grin...<br>
could bring me to my knees.</p><br>

<p>
And so...before you win...<br>
before the bad totally overshadows the good...<br>
before I feel better without you, than with you...<br>
before I forget...just how much I cared...</p><br>

<p>
I want to capture this feeling<br>
and freeze it in time.</p><br>

<p>
Before it's too late...<br>
before I forget.</p><br>
