<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	-- The world is not hard to see, <br>
for each one of us cannot help but be a part of it.  <br>
We are each a participle for a world, the predicate of our actions. <br> 
The world we are, and so worldly we be.  </p><br>

<p>
We spawn worldly places, <br>
villages, cultures, concepts and ideas. <br>
&nbsp; We pass like the days we change with the seasons.   <br>
not out of touch with human nature can we ever be.  </p><br>

<p>
&nbsp; Summer’s triumphs always fall as the leaves do. <br>
&nbsp; Winter’s over only to rise again in the spring where vernal life<br>
&nbsp; turns over vernal death to the other side- [undo the knots]</p><br>

<p>
How each spring does pertain to much more than warm light; <br>
for each spring is a beginning<br>
&nbsp; that has no future beyond that one summer.  </p><br>

<p>
&nbsp; Is not each summer the one and only?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As if it did happen again and again over and over.   <br>
Always changing the figures the objects<br>
It all never was anything more than faces in the clouds. </p><br>
