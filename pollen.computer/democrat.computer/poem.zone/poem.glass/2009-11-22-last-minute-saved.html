<p>
Flower dreams fall curtains every night <br>
the bands and the people dance the feeling seems right<br>
&nbsp; -but the next day's- coming round-</p><br>

<p>
Wake up! Its dawn. Light and fall asleep the hours seem long<br>
yet fly by- you wait<br>
too long it’s dark before its five now<br>
did find <br>
and no smile flashed before your eyes<br>
the house is cold by midnight<br>
&nbsp; the people and memories gone away</p><br>

<p>
It’s time to dream the wars they fall before your eyes<br>
the sounds they haunt your sleep at night<br>
and wake without a rustling sound of someone<br>
run out and meet the friends who wait in the drive <br>
you'll drive away before you dress right, your shoes are left behind<br>
that road that goes nowhere and follows the lake shore </p><br>

<p>
and end up with tears in your-eyes in that car <br>
you found no happy thought that you were looking for-</p><br>

<p>
That night you thought there was nothing you live for<br>
no fire nor hierophant to find <br>
in your eyes there was something you were hiding <br>
I closed mine<br>
the movement they didn't - seem right<br>
was swinging out of this world<br>
too fast, too slow<br>
everything just turned-round so fast<br>
at last this time <br>
there was somewhere to- could go <br>
and find that those people were always there<br>
in a dream-like-world that slips beneath the forms here<br>
and breath your take you there or in daylight just think about <br>
this last night. </p><br>

<p>
I would never let tears leave your eyes <br>
until-  (you and I, or) until the world ends I will find each drop</p><br>
