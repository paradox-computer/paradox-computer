<p>
life for humans is a process of giving up,<br>
&nbsp; depriving oneself slowly, <br>
a gradual reduction,<br>
&nbsp; a dilution. <br>
-no matter- <br>
maintain the warmth for square miles,<br>
&nbsp; frozen winter hover over above<br>
who became travelers <br>
burnt their papers<br>
who died young </p><br>

<p>
is transient<br>
ushered, beaten with words<br>
starved, depraved, terrified by actions<br>
A short history of representations<br>
prepare for your dreams<br>
prepare for your dreams</p><br>

<p>
come to manifest a past life<br>
for that identity will save you-<br>
oh  stars guide me <br>
show the path, compressed road<br>
the light above two distend towns <br>
hovers in the dark air <br>
the dark air</p><br>

<p>
every day's a long road you walk down <br>
what do you end up doing for yourself now<br>
listen my friend i'm not worried i'm just out of site <br>
out of line and mind <br>
get back to sleep<br>
keep telling yourself story my friend<br>
brush or sleep off <br>
let’s get ready to solve the problem </p><br>

<p>
I'm not gonna forget <br>
so let’s sing tiny little love songs to the walls<br>
let’s play how much can you dream yourself<br>
how come you're the one I want but you are not moving over me like I'm your body</p><br>

<p>
I hear the dog sleep. <br>
I smell him in the air </p><br>
<br>

<p>
I'm thinking of you.<br>
feeling bad for your lover because he would be a great dad <br>
who grew immune to psychology<br>
and differentiated  from our predecessors</p><br>
<br>

<p>
the world is not only sick in the way that fosters in-humanity <br>
the world is at large insane <br>
human life simply hangs in the air <br>
era turns new old <br>
sepia, black and white now blast with color fright<br>
&nbsp; has a transformation in communication</p><br>
