<p>
April </p><br>

<p>
Guns guns america !
don't take them too far away-</p><br>

<p>
&nbsp; where were you my sweet heart baby?
come back from -so far?
coming on strong
&nbsp; you are
summer</p><br>

<p>
past their street-case past their stairwell 
up in arms and all 
ashamed -crazed for one thing
one in all and nones the same say something 
all around the word sound like u never
&nbsp; that your heart could break
there is just a hardened down part of me that knows what it's like 
all these 
broken down </p><br>

<p>
follow me around
and day and night </p><br>

<p>
look around all see I fall awake 
light bulbs burn out one by one </p><br>

<p>
stabilized like the bridge,
- balanced building 
&nbsp; -on that downward force -that spinning round
hold you up (at arms) arrange this content and it aligned you: cities; building upon building
ground for the conquered 
guns america guns and armatta  
and we find our brothers bedding guns and in-format of bullets and our si
so weather on fen with piling nor on granite we build 
and weather- there is solid ground or not there are forces about this world 
and our misconceptions, among them  </p><br>

<p>
amount to being one of them, </p><br>

<p>
along with
oh - gravity, oh electromagnetism, follow us, carry  today </p><br>

<p>
-and how physics sustains us
&nbsp; and your arms are a thousand acres and your back is a continent and every civilization and word is there,  - not just a recapitulation but sometime in its entirety so that you ar I treat you like a world for you are equal to it in its breadth, richness and magnanimity. 
so I will let others be the sun
others be the dark night 
but you are rock and earth- 
donâ€™t take this too far</p><br>
