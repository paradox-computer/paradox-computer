<p>
 Contemplating off nights from off balconies<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;extend songs and memories a lifetime-<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;in realizing only once a flower</p><br>

<p>
 In my life I have been sheltered and cloaked-<br>
 &nbsp; and brought out to see the world which belongs to me</p><br>

<p>
 Into the cold streets at night, into the cities<br>
 &nbsp; up into the fortresses of doomed people<br>
 &nbsp; fallacies of cement and machine longing to be touched</p><br>

<p>
 Rip off the cloak reveal the clockwork chest beneath<br>
 &nbsp; hearts seize in distaste gorge eyes to see<br>
 I felt so gorged and destroyed<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;   so left alone<br>
 &nbsp; cold to walk aimlessly at night and cry<br>
 &nbsp; for no way out. Blink and <br>
 &nbsp; eyes only tears are left<br>
 &nbsp; with the warmness and tingle of sensation which is life</p><br>

<p>
 Tear down tapestries and installations of<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  memories unfold blow out candles and<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  away the ashes down stairs slam-door<br>
  hold back tears and do not extinguish the fire<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;   which burns the rooms behind</p><br>

<p>
 I fear not the day nor the coldness of the nights<br>
 &nbsp; I fear not blindness nor sickness I fear not <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  to loose the motions of the moon.</p><br>

<p>
 I am bound here and bound to become<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;    unwound here<br>
 While waiting our minds become unbound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;    unwound we hear the crazy</p><br>

<p>
 our own stories sing out as unbound and crazed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;   voices unwinding conversations -a cacophony only loosely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;   and figuratively tethered</p><br>

<p>
 There is conquest calling captives of hope and<br>
&nbsp;  dreams and frames beyond grasp.  Gated alloy ally<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;    ends narrow passages of lost and forgotten friends</p><br>

<p>
 There is delirious chaotic rhapsody<br>
&nbsp;  delivering oaths and vows and prose on those <br>
&nbsp;   rooftops and railways, riverboats and blow<br>
&nbsp;  away the dust of the past</p><br>

<p>
&nbsp; There is haunting honor always there is a<br>
&nbsp;  singularity of hope forgotten hope lost<br>
&nbsp;  hope forever have for always there is<br>
&nbsp;  darkness to only juxtapose the light<br>
 depressions in the valley shows the peaks their<br>
 &nbsp;  mighty height</p><br>

<p>
 all is still surfaces and noises and looks and stares<br>
&nbsp;  and movement beneath the skin breathing in<br>
&nbsp;  rhythm yet breathless, yet gasping<br>
 choking and drowning</p><br>

<p>
 all is still spinning - orbiting celestial bodies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;     slowly slip away -slink sickness  and insanity<br>
 &nbsp;  Institution and individual defeat. eaten and digested<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;   by a machine</p><br>

<p>
 all is still lost intangible confusion<br>
&nbsp;   dousing text forever forgotten as a theme of history<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;    wage war and only war and still be lost</p><br>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;   hack away coughing lungs ash for<br>
  morning pills night ones too rolling off<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;    the tongue<br>
   piercing echoing crash and shatter</p><br>

<p>
  Softly dying slowly suffering cold smoking<br>
 &nbsp;  wrapped in blankets seated standing shivering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  to keep warm at night home we go-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;     alone we go</p><br>


<p>	Anything to make a heart beat?<br>
 &nbsp;     Anything to make it go?<br>
 &nbsp;         laughing cafe? movie show?</p><br>

<p>
   Pound or crack my chest, diffuse or circulate<br>
 &nbsp;    my blood my heart is in arrest.</p><br>

<p>
  This is my own and only life -I have but<br>
 &nbsp;  one arrow one bow one swift let go</p><br>

<p>
    Best aim your sight right:</p><br>

<p>
   Draw the tenseness in the string</p><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;        hold your wrist and figure right and know which<br>
 &nbsp;     foot to lead with-</p><br>

<p>
  I once had all the time between<br>
 &nbsp;   these valleys rivers waterfalls and green</p><br>

<p>
   We were ordained here -where memories and time<br>
   stand still and wavers at our command here <br>
   leaves and trees and forest walks and long and brave <br>
 &nbsp;   romantic talks about this place we will<br>
    never find</p><br>

<p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;      Tripping in cars down railway on buses on<br>
   mountains in plains over bridges rusty water<br>
  over snow and into mud and darkness and terrible forests and<br>
&nbsp;    into the morning</p><br>

<p>  
 &nbsp;  Every morning in low traveling off mountains<br>
  into afternoons in harmony and down down-<br>
  pick up drive and turn around</p><br>

<p>
  Now dangling off balconies and wavering<br>
 &nbsp;  tapestries and blowing prayers off into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;   the night over roads and rooftops and across<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;    the water</p><br>

<p>
    We only save each-other listen intently<br>
 &nbsp;      to stories and hear only the voices of friends<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;       and see only faces we know or do not want to</p><br>

<p>
   We march we trudge we curse the same streets<br>
   we sing in summer and in spring we dance them<br>
 &nbsp;   wearing out lines and soles, -stories and<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;    sayings conducive to explosive laughter and endorphin</p><br>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;     Anything to keep going?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;     to keep the night at bay we<br>
   laugh as time brushes these thoughts and memories away </p><br>
