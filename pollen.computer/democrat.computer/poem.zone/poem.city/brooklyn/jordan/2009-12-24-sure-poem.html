<p>
Be it fair that the sun did rise today<br>
up over the forests, the leave less trees.<br>
Yellow roar like an army hail of arrows <br>
came down before up rose<br>
&nbsp; that orb<br>
&nbsp; to call victory over <br>
the earth and night</p><br>

<p>
And you did sleep unbeknownst to me<br>
like blankets covered vale by snow </p><br>

<p>
you were <br>
where that besiegement by the sun <br>
was to take me<br>
one year I give myself to find you<br>
as another year has passed <br>
by no longer measure than the year before </p><br>

<p>
I have but dreams to follow to you<br>
-your mischief in my dreams</p><br>

<p>
Be it that the sunlight did break out-<br>
break away- from the cloudy sky <br>
daylight minute by minute <br>
under-which you will find me<br>
less I find myself here, <br>
again on the solstice of this passing year<br>
be that it will become a memory <br>
or you will have interrupted these lines </p><br>

<p>
What chances I take! <br>
&nbsp; -they are great, those chances <br>
it is my will to do so and to fulfill the chances of another <br>
I can shroud my symbolism like a lock <br>
&nbsp; -and no-one can undo it<br>
unlocked and understand <br>
the symbolism but <br>
you make no effort to move against it, it simply fell before you<br>
as trembling in dishabille I stand <br>
alone but unscathed<br>
&nbsp; less for my bleeding mind <br>
my trembling hands raised poised against old age</p><br>

<p>
will you rise to call my name-<br>
will you unfreeze, dis-suspend from time-<br>
brush off the snow and find me here-<br>
or will you brush past the sensory receptors I have placed for you to find me by?<br>
(letâ€™s say we found each-other if you reach me through a painting)<br>
though if be it that you were just some scrupulous detail on a canvas<br>
my lip would quiver at the thought of that </p><br>

<p>
If you were after all just the wind<br>
-I would not stand to hear<br>
&nbsp; - wail wind by my window <br>
fair be it more than just the wind you are <br>
or I beseeched the world for nothing <br>
after all this; screaming words at the air <br>
like a gun with blank shots to hear but nothing is felt<br>
no fallen foe symbolizing victory<br>
no forceful power to fall foe by <br>
but my words are not aimed at some foe external to me<br>
it is up to me I am fairly sure to be the one to make it happen<br>
my capacity is to realize dreams every one that haunts me I will to find them </p><br>
