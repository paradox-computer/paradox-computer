From nothing I imagine<br>
No reason not to run and branch<br>
with fractal shapes like ink runs<br>
free on wet paper<br>
There is nothing that contains me<br>
All we know we should free<br>
 -and let be wild<br>
Let all our understanding be and so ourselves be wild!</p><br>

	<p>
Let us block set, so to print<br>
Only so to smear it all away<br>
free ink and so let be free on pages<br>
they will be the exclamations of our days<br>
freed but onto each other we will laugh as we brush<br>
all once we knew away<br>
Be it reduced to ash -all we once did know<br>
Be it reduced to ink and paper<br>
and thus only lack the infinity of water</p><br>

	<p>
I am captivated by the seasons<br>
I am entoken to the land that signifies me<br>
Satisfy the land does not me<br>
nor the words that seemingly I impress-<br>
Run free!</p><br>

	<p>
Let be what will begin<br>
Let be that march unto ashen ends<br>
Let be that wrong road follow<br>
So, be it not wrong until discovered<br>
that the choices we faced were free<br>
So be free and I will follow<br>
So die, for I will-<br>
Be ashes, I will be-<br>
If washed away and so will I be-<br>
If you are words I will match them-<br>
Set letters and I will press them-<br>
If you are the ink, I will be but a brush stroke away</p><br>

	<p>
Water, if it free you to be<br>
-Ink, formless, an oscillation between what is thoughts and what is words and<br>
what is spoken, said, undone confusion;<br>
testimony that was given up, to and about<br>
floating unconscious in the waters of the mind<br>
echoing and lightning up-<br>
   - connections, webs and networks of thoughts</p><br>

	<p>
-The grand machine,<br>
  -how you are not fair!<br>
and though I will fair, do speak I can<br>
And I wonder in which does move me and I imagine<br>
provocations that-are still standing<br>
fleets of ships that are burning<br>
people who are losing and aging and are no more</p><br>

	<p>
Why can’t you be real?  Why philosophy is as true as it’s taken to be</p><br>

	<p>
These words are about you and I<br>
When together, how we argue-<br>
And when apart they echo in my mind<br>
arguments would tear apart so many kind<br>
How rips apart families<br>
How wade into war<br>
How tear to insanity<br>
Philosophy is not princess over sciences<br>
yet she does not cut cheaply into lives<br>
Our arguments some day insulate<br>
and it is in this sense that I rely on you<br>
to deconstruct out space and time<br>
Remove me, for I am captive by a world that no longer gleams<br>
I have forgotten the wild and am amidst the forest as so speaking<br>
Will you speaker out your voice and return to the wind<br>
your words, your free style-?-<br>
I cannot help to see it in your eyes<br>
And so irrational I speak!<br>
How can it be rational<br>
I beg the question; tell me?</p><br>

	<p>
For someday I will not to answer<br>
my will be lost<br>
like all those surround me<br>
Everything is lost until found the strength<br>
I will exact upon the diss-aligned<br>
but I am!  You have the quality of strength<br>
to be set about in this writing,<br>
it’s not rational to imagine<br>
‘something new’ it’s hard to pre-suppose existed before it happened-<br>
By time the planet spins around the solar system<br>
one revolution,<br>
-things could be completely different</p><br>
