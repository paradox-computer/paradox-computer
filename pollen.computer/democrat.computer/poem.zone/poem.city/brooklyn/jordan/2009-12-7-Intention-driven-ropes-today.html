-Reject or be forced to contradict oneself-<br>
The pattern can be deduced, reduced and distinguished<br>
&nbsp; -but to see, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -is a matter of happening<br>
co-fated with the decision you make <br>
-(the uncoiling of the rope)<br>
-the unwinding of a chain from a wench<br>
links in place, knots<br>
ready to take place as time marches on<br>
not going to give you an answer <br>
Did that train derail for no reason what so ever?<br>
maybe you could not have done of yourself that you did</p><br> 

<p>
What you favor you watch out for;<br>
as I watch you <br>
predict your motions<br>
I imagine fated for a better place <br>
Not one that their words make out<br>
there was no train to take you, <br>
walk the hill sides, climb up, descend, suspend in time if you are late <br> 
- become enlightened -by them-</p><br>
