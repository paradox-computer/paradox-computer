-guilty of name calling and biasing the audience which is propaganda 
guilty of manufacturing a problem, arrant distortion of the law, card stacking 
image words  irrelevant details  
the non sequitur question 
guilty of argumentum ad baculum, appeal to force "if you do not cooperate you 
double standard</p><br>

<p>
truth and love 
- looking over what from artists pockets falls</p><br>

<p>
&nbsp; -read the future
&nbsp; -don't know what happened 
well who can reads the past
supernatural beauty  
who let them break </p><br>

<p>
&nbsp; a-lot of thinking can stop for a minute </p><br>

<p>
for the last one -  to hang o'er into the next life 
grant you fair safe passage keeping yourself un scathed 
that is granted like a light for the way </p><br>

<p>
yet always too late on that note </p><br>

<p>
never had a dream
&nbsp; so bright like nothing
ever stopped you before </p><br>

<p>
reading over your words one more time for no reason and shutter your windows and close your blinds for the sunrise is coming ?</p><br>
