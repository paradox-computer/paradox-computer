<p>
When you look over <br>
each word each line each syllable <br>
-as they arrange in you mind<br>
let the syntax form a kind of auditory hallucination<br>
and know that visions mine <br>
no matter what vision you see</p><br>

<p>
So, but how did I come across this life?<br>
when all that I am was taken from others, <br>
the roads through the lands were cleared before<br>
the thousand year's houses designed<br>
the life style the diction already in line<br>
as all you knew did come to signify me,<br>
so someday they will come to belong to another<br>
and though they may not come to know you<br>
nor to hear me <br>
yet what we make of things does reach to them<br>
As so you were so crucial in creating me<br>
And be like every known phenomena  <br>
unknown to be <br>
other things and forces known to be</p><br>

<p>
Things known to happen <br>
being but dispositions <br>
to see some event clearly while all sudden time<br>
spills out and truly is seem-less</p><br>

<p>
Show me a seam where time spills through, <br>
for there are none,<br>
-just this movement and slow precession<br>
through language, through science, through physics and life<br>
all the time nothing holds them<br>
nothing pins them in place in part of<br>
or on top of or under another, <br>
What is side by side is really one thing<br>
that is every affinity between them <br>
our words to describe the world-<br>
nothing in the world is like them<br>
nothing holds anything<br>
nor does anything move slowly <br>
there is nothing to move in comparison to<br>
just one big rock, water and sunlight in the mind </p><br>

<p>
One world, one science<br>
the mind generates you for me<br>
the mind laboratory<br>
the mind which consumes one third of my energy</p><br>

<p>
Mind give me time<br>
and all understanding there can ever be</p><br>
