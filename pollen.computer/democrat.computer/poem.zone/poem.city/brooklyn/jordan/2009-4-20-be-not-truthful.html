<p>
Be not truthful with your story <br>
if you want I will lie too<br>
I can say you flapped your wings and off into a night breeze flew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  -packed your bags and flapped your wings-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  -say you could not wait on morning</p><br>
 
<p>
For truth be told you did not but whisper<br>
truth be told, you left me<br>
I hardly heard but the echos of your departure </p><br>

<p>
So I will lie with my capacity to reason<br>
for I can reason that somewhere you are alive <br>
yet my heart beats you are different <br>
It bashes against my chest with rhythm <br>
yet, I dare not let it see and give it vision <br>
my reason says it lies plainly as it speaks<br>
and so my heart I lie to let you be<br>
My intuitionâ€™s truth is something different<br>
It says you will return but never be who I remember</p><br>

<p>
I can numerate you with examples, <br>
argue others to conclusive ends, <br>
only but so far as I can imagine<br>
and so lie that what I speak exists </p><br>

<p>
I will not, I will not<br>
I will lie </p><br>

<p>
I will not lie to preserve my memories,<br>
for now they are my memories<br>
and my heart holds them<br>
And I will not give it but an ounce of dissatisfaction</p><br>

<p>
I will lie to preserve you -peace <br>
The ghost is in the past now<br>
And who I meet I lie and say is someone whole and new.<br>
So reason my exact upon it<br>
yet so clear and naked is to lie in philosophy</p><br>

<p>
For you have taken with you in philosophy <br>
my reason to believe<br>
lies and truth is all crazy madness<br>
I cannot in truth believe, you will come back,<br>
So I lie to say to</p><br>
