<p>
If I am not frightened<br>
If I am not sad<br>
If nor am I mad<br>
Then what is fear?<br>
What is sadder or madder?<br>
but a brush of electricity<br>
the electromagnetic storm of a dream<br>
the corporal grip of a nightmare<br>
Happy birthday my sorrow<br>
one year older my fear<br>
how my sadness went quickly </p><br>

<p>
When it comes to perception it’s hard to say there is any sense about it. <br>
It breaks my heart it rips at me, it’s got me in its hold <br>
I am cold<br>
I’m cold blooded<br>
cold hearted<br>
selfish and old<br>
my mind becomes weary</p><br>

<p>
Absolute certainty that never is going anywhere<br>
who are you ?<br>
I am but a participle for a greater action <br>
So, but the part of me that wills, to be <br>
is frightened <br>
frightened solely from what can be imagined<br>
nothing can’t be<br>
everything is contingent upon my being <br>
when the justifier is external  <br>
I am not mine<br>
and, so to be predicated by another <br>
forever realized by nothing but ash and electricity,<br>
water and sunlight and my paper<br>
ground of being <br>
rest in certainty </p><br>
