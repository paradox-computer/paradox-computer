<p>
passion: what went wrong- <br>
- the sun rises <br>
over hills -you'll go back<br>
your dreams are gone<br>
- but you'll be back again</p><br>

<p>
they were likely to see everything in the light <br>
though the colors were there all night<br>
it-s a long way there <br>
I'll make something up to your body<br>
and get in touch with you</p><br>

<p>
baby, now you're telling me all these things<br>
&nbsp; -last week would've been the time for them</p><br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
- no! you're not strong <br>
who is on a different path through life<br>
stones skipping over some options <br>
others choices others not </p><br>
<br>

<p>
- drive it away <br>
drive it away <br>
- here what I say </p><br>

<p>
beings driven away from the city  <br>
you are of a handful of people I miss<br>
sometimes I call others by your name <br>
sometimes I call you by the name of another <br>
- when I saw the mountains across the water <br>
they have special meaning<br>
I will make sure</p><br>

<p>
even though we tried for something new<br>
a plaster cast of a cast <br>
ends as the bare outline of the face</p><br>

<p>
- get this together?<br>
I was just about to set back on your heels you, sweet eyes, </p><br>

<p>
you're the faces <br>
like their your masks and you wear them<br>
your the things i'm just about to call mistakes and then am afraid to
give me a moment and so i will try to explain,<br>
- it’s no gamble<br>
just can’t be that <br>
stranger things have come and gone past </p><br>

<p>
maybe the wind will blow this town away <br>
storms have come to this valley <br>
storms hit this valley over there, <br>
by the rivers<br>
- how they come up <br>
you know the way home <br>
let’s have a few words we will say <br>
one moment after our hope passes  here I am <br>
just see what sons and daughters are<br>
&nbsp; in trying and in trying not to be <br>
I think it’s the story we debate over.</p><br>
<br>

<p>
living contained <br>
living with confederates who praise morality <br>
one you got it where are you going</p><br>
