<p>
the waves across the surface<br>
like ripples are on water you are those pulsations on them </p><br>

<p>
known like wind is known but organized unlike wind<br>
you are - all its effect, its force <br>
And so, but unlike all the air <br>
in which you are suspended like words, thoughts-</p><br>

<p>
you are by air's side in movement<br>
its touch by your tongue becomes spoken <br>
as like differentiated air parts cool by warm </p><br>

<p>
you move like wind's arrangement with the storm cloud-<br>
with the blue sky,<br>
- with the cool night and sea</p><br>

<p>
- structured more highly than that chaos, brings you cool breeze <br>
is your clear mind <br>
there that spells it.</p><br>

<p>
yet why not go on just some longer<br>
cross the surface, water, by which waves on your arrival</p><br>
