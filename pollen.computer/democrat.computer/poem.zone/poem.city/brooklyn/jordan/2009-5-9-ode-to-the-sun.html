<p>
Ode to the sun<br>
the fixed hanging star<br>
It is to you that we owe life to<br>
and as darkness falls here <br>
somewhere not far off<br>
there is daytime on which is predicated by another</p><br>

<p>
Forever realized by nothing but ash and electricity,<br>
water and sunlight and my paper<br>
ground of being <br>
rest in certainty </p><br>
<p>
never stop, never sleep <br>
the night never reaches you<br>
far off you hold us in place <br>
and only the moon's shadow blocks you</p><br>
<p>
As I stand in the penumbra-<br>
for a moment you fail to be<br>
yet your gravity, your radiation, <br>
it reaches me </p><br>
