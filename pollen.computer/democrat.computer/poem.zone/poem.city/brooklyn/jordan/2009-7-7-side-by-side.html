<p>
How you did side with stormy weather<br>
and how stormy it did get <br>
how you did not bear me there to betray me <br>
just brought me to your stormy side<br>
So by side with, uproar, outcry- </p><br>

<p>
There where I hope the meter changes-<br>
each word sounding takes a long time<br>
may smooth lips sing them<br>
yet be all our understanding is so different</p><br>

<p>
So, be different! those words-<br>
complete endless circles if you want to<br>
lay descriptions like to stones<br>
lay epitaphs in people, names and places</p><br>

<p>
Yet know, those words, be careful how you say them<br>
take care with how you cast your words out<br>
be it that you lay them in stone names or<br>
vicious circles, in philosophy. </p><br>

<p>
When some day will rise a difference <br>
between what is said and what is undone confusion<br>
and then when least expected, it will all change <br>
unless reduced to ashes, someday the words <br>
will mean something different how we speak and say <br>
[when our world is different]</p><br>

<p>
So I -side by side with stormy weather-<br>
wonder where the wind -does take me <br>
out to go and watch the tense rain-<br>
walk out over earth-en washed <br>
and that is just the speaking part of me</p><br>

<p>
Not chaos will weather ever be <br>
never what is chaos<br>
and though no more we know it to be<br>
So, but why not let life feel like chaos and <br>
 -lend not that description of the other to the weather</p><br>

<p>
That belief is too far to be predicated by another 
so by side with another<br>
that is chaos- and was not in the weather<br>
but is one single storm and evening<br>
So too forth will it be a fixed point <br>
The storm and me   <br>
Who be that storm?  what it is made of cannot be let go of</p><br>
