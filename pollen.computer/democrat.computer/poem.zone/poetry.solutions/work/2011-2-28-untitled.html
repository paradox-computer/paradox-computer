<p>
who wants children <br>
who longs for that explanation<br>
who knew one and who knew another language <br>
you lay down <br>
what is like my life for me<br>
who are intimate with another<br>
who are intimate with<br>
that after wedding smell that fume<br>
TO GET IN TO OR OUT OF THE BUSINESS<br>
take someone up on their offer</p><br>

<p>
I just want to kiss your lips<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  both small round parts- &nbsp; a breath of fresh air<br>
because their is terror you inspire me<br>
because there is like a candle in a dark night <br>
one single chance to see<br>
something new <br>
because yes I've been waiting to experience<br>
to change To prove my self and others wrong because I forgot this then<br>
because I forgot this then <br>
and then you.  <br>
you are one in a deck of cards <br>
I want to go away with you<br>
I want you to feel absolutely safe with me<br>
don't tell<br>
but</p><br>

<br>
<p>
&nbsp; who wrote graffiti got up <br>
whose lexicon reflected passion <br>
taking those highways to their end <br>
who saw fabulous light who blew up <br>
fought in the subways  <br>
couldn't remember for two hours after leaving dinner<br>
who grew up like that <br>
who's your hold back<br>
&nbsp; what's the deal when you're so like that<br>
what's the deal then - <br>
who are all those other cards?</p><br>

<p>
to loose another and to have a twin <br>
your heart won't be mine but I will take care of it<br>
I checked your eyes I checked them twice <br>
why would you hold my gaze<br>
and your beautiful hands- I saw them <br>
you can help me see it alright<br>
look over my shoulder for me<br>
to be thrust into this postmodern life <br>
let's get this show on the road<br>
&nbsp; oh<br>
this show on the road</p><br>

<p>
the black water ripped through the countryside <br>
you can describe it </p><br>
