<p>
how could it not be a mistake to let you go <br>
and not ask while i still can if you </p><br>

<br>
<p>
oh the sun rises <br>
over hills you'll go back<br>
your dreams are gone but you'll be back again</p><br>
<p>
they were likely to see everything in the light though<br>
the colors were there all night</p><br>
<p>
I'll make up to your body<br>
it’s a long way there <br>
I would get in touch with your body </p><br>

<br>
<p>
baby now you’re telling me all these things and last week would ahem been the time for them</p><br>
