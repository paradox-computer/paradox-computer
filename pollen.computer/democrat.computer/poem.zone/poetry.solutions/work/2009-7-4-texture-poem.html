	<p>

When some morning, like all they do -the birds sing <br>
bursting shrill - all so warm noises sleep through <br></p>
<br>
 	<p>
Nothing same surround them but light as air <br>
and the sleepy language between them and clouds speak <br></p>


<br>
	<p>They speak come rain in daylight, block the sun <br>
dress the moon, mornings and twilight  <br></p>


<br>
	<p>
So come clouds and speaker your wispy voice rain <br>
tell the cherished stories, share your evening <br>
For I am by atmosphere where in the rainy season- everything is <br>
and so to for will be everything together  <br>
built out of determination <br>
that is nothing ever built <br></p>

<br>
	<p>
So it be a memory and never more meaningless <br>
it has no odor and taste - not like the fleshy brain residue <br>
so be it caught up in the forests <br>
-what stones around call to you <br>
-what do textures speak to you <br>
as you run your hand across them <br>
-stone surfaces, iconography  <br>
run your hand across the water <br>
the sunlight and the air <br>
what does the ash of me feel to you?</p>

<br>
	<p>
What does it speak? with no words <br>
but other side of who is empathy <br>
cast about in long sighs, eye movement, signs and sacrifices <br>
and a radiation of textures that dare to speak <br>
they cannot fail you now will I ever dare-<br>
rip apart the textures of the stones, the earthen ground <br>
By which process some day our ashes turned to<br>
bound time bound space together </p> 

<br>
	<p>
The calm before the storm -and <br>
how stormy it will get <br>
here in this place<br>
I will side by side with stormy weather<br>
for a chance to find <br>
comfort too good to find <br>
in the wild wind <br>
soaked by rain and charred by fire.</p>
