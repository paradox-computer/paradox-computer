<p>
let me give you this one new page<br>
where old pages end<br>
where know what lay forgotten was so not<br>
forgotten not and could be <br>
when oceans shine sunrise<br>
take the gold lift from the waters<br>
rise and let be that pass you over us<br>
back past back left what had fair<br>
had left behind</p><br>

<p>
Where will our haunted sorrow go?<br>
I dare not blame you <br>
so come of banished sorrow not less I blame you<br>
come from altered and forgotten mountains</p><br>

<p>
For only did this moment I realize <br>
for you to be with like dream to my life<br>
less no life you bring to another<br>
less not no infant life and a life of another kind</p><br>

<p>
Fair be not that the sun did rise today <br>
forever it will rise and over the ocean</p><br>

<p>
Fair that love did banish me <br>
for all that I am it did banished <br>
the revolution of the earth and season meant nothing to be</p><br>

<p>
So, for when others can lavish in their desires I cannot<br>
they lavish because they can and it feels good to their emotion<br>
so, but they have a lifetime of it <br>
taken from me -so now that I command the texture of it-</p><br>

<p>
Where some lives can lavish in the experience of emotion<br>
I create it and so to for will I always make that choice to</p><br>

<p>
So, but when and where others are rewarded for their love <br>
with bonds, and so are rewarded with life and infants, children to love<br>
They grow old having filled themselves<br>
I cannot have hate for them <br>
for then to would my forgiveness of my own love be a contradiction</p><br>

<p>
Space and time cross out and reach by day or moon light, and only fairly speak I can for I cannot see and if I can it fails to make sense </p><br>

<p>
For all that I am cannot neither be-not not-be made sense of <br>
how can that be<br>
how could we let go<br>
let go<br>
throw it to the floor<br>
and let be</p><br>

<p>
someone who cannot be <br>
for that cross the lake fresh waters there is some like place and life I cannot compete with<br>
I can not compete with cast mirages and empathy and empty theories. </p><br>

<p>
who would choose metaphysics over a family <br>
because having that kind of love <br>
nothing can be like it <br>
not good love can my love ever be</p><br>

<p>
my dreams have such movements in moments but my art in step cannot keep </p><br>
