<p>
The high roads touch the ceiling<br>
you know their great minds never reach them<br>
you know they weren't asking for themselves<br>
but there they were asking<br>
you’r’a gonna have to provide some reasons why<br>
you are asking you were there<br>
were you not?<br>
I did note some of them were crazy<br>
some of them were viciously sounding <br>
[out of their minds<br>
how did you know that<br>
they were out there?]<br>
outnumbered<br>
&nbsp; every time<br>
who can accept loss<br>
you are what you fear<br>
we are our worst enemy<br>
that fits like the glove we wear<br>
fear is not beneath the skin <br>
but on top of it</p><br>
