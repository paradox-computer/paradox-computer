		<p style="text-align:right">April, 2009</p>


<p>Part 1</p><br>
<p>
Take memories, unfold them-<br>
time and space; words control them-<br>
tapestries and installations-<br>
art, and sun-day trailing conversations </p><br>

<p>
You leave only echoes behind<br>
footsteps in this hill-side city<br>
-dancing down hallway streets, in the snow-<br>
-wild wind, soaked by rain and charred by fire-</p><br>

<p>
We stormed those institutions-<br>
We stole their relics-<br>
-to parade them-<br>
the songs we sung: they resounded out across the open air</p><br>
 
<p>
We coalesced in where everything we ever wanted was-<br>
seeing our dreams- out slowly- as they happened</p><br>

<p>
Can we not say we did forge what happened?<br>
We did craft, we carved, as if we could regret the choices that we made-<br>
If we were solid stone that edifice would bear our names</p><br>

<p>
But reach our lips- it was Tova, to whom I owe everything<br>
and but only can give back, again, memories unfolding-<br>
Being not small wrinkles, being not on the edges-<br>
these lines run-cross the pages</p><br>

<p>
You are the binding of a book that cannot be the book of shadows<br>
Your generation by means of some majestic manipulation<br>
bestow the brilliant -vibrant colors, in and of yourself you did imagine </p><br>

<p>
So, but you can dust off this town<br>
not because the bricks and streets do not glisten any longer<br>
they only shine dull in comparison to what you can remember-<br>
[remember, discover by imagination] </p><br>

<p>
-Our memories are stars, far off suns<br>
and they are orbiting celestial bodies<br>
whom now and others someday will transcend us</p><br>

<p>
So, but we were - for just a moment,<br>
I met you, a thousand revolutions of the sun from today<br>
 -I knew you longer<br>
 -measurements being not whatâ•’s wrong<br>
just our imaginations' sensations stronger-<br>
Our birthdays corresponding to<br>
 -the only solstices and equinoxes- <br>
The calendars that matter only to each other<br>
I laugh and pray I knew you one year longer</p><br>

<p>
The paint isn't fading; the colors- <br>
only splashes<br>
-we will see those reverberations <br>
far off in the distant future<br>
-we will be- remember<br>
-our memories unfolding</p><br>

<p>
Chanting like a favorite trance tech-no<br>
-blue-glass bulbs, glazed with electricity<br>
screams and lies and angry crying eyes<br>
-we were the liars and the screamers <br>
our eyes rain cried-</p><br>

<p>
 Fear not the day -nor the coldness of the nights<br>
 -not blindness nor sickness, nor -<br>
  -fear to loose the motions of the moon.<br>
 Looked out over and across any empty city<br>
we seemed to be as guards, over its happening<br>
-the grand constructions of our dreams<br>
-the branches of our night-mares </p><br>

<p>
Vacationing only to find- how awful being alone is;<br>
dragging ourselves, or being dragged-<br>
 -never finding a convincing argument </p><br>

<p>
We wanted to be those innocent children-
on the playground, swinging, running,
-pushing shoving up over fences 
hiding in-between the bushes-
We wanted to find everything new for one last time-
venturing out into the early morning for nothing
-and being satisfied, all alone, being untamed in the morning-</p><br>

<p>
Realized by archaic rituals <br>
-feeling cast by shadows, contained to the moonlight-<br>
we saw together the rooms filled with nothing <br>
we tripped down the same iron staircases,<br>
-onto the shore, into the cool waters<br>
-we were soaked by night time</p><br>

<p>
So, but we built it as a city on a hill</p><br>

<p>
By those-same ethics,  which drive us,<br>
so do condemn us<br>
As like the Aztecs who were driven-<br>
-out into the mist and glacial lake-fresh waters</p><br>

<p>
So drift out, unfold memories, blow away dust the<br>
-ashes, throw the colors in the waters</p><br>

<p>
From your balcony remember -waves of prayers-</p><br>

<p>
So many things happening-so-quickly <br>
the lines are being drawn-still, yet moving<br>
-a platform far above the battle<br>
enshrined by relics,  -a space created-<br>
for a ritual, which is life, <br>
-the clock-work beneath skin</p><br>

<p>&nbsp;
</p><br>

<p>Part  2</p><br>

<p>
As the sun rises over me in this place,<br>
as the sun rises and as the sun sets <br><br>
I sit and I wonder in which slowly does move me</p><br>

<p>
Out across the airways, over roads, <br>
through and in-between the buildings<br>
in the jungles of far off places</p><br>

<p>
We have seen the temples destroyed<br>
we have seen the tops of mountains <br>
where the ruins stand, as they are-<br>
fallen, sinking into the earth<br>
images of what all our people did once imagine</p><br>

<p>
All is stone surfaces, the iconography<br>
captivated mental states<br>
the vision, the sensation, those explicit symbols,<br>
glyphs which are to their creators, after-life</p><br>

<p>
So, but they had no conception-<br>
we would remark them as mental- <br>
yet only the hard rocks retain them<br>
their solidity is static and life is too fluttering<br>
to smash our skulls against the solid rock walls.<br>
Our signification is not en-graven <br>
we exist in the mental states we touch<br>
-care not if we create them, worry not if they persist <br>
-our signs will be there, breathing, contemplating on the open airways </p><br>

<p>
There is delirious chaotic rhapsody<br>
  -delivering oaths and vows and prose on those <br>
  - rooftops and railways, riverboats and blow<br>
  away the dust of the past</p><br>

<p>&nbsp;
</p><br>

<p>
Part 3</p><br>

<p>
How much more we love each other than we love ourselves</p><br>

<p>
I would push you up the latter, <br>
- save you as chaos ensued the rooms behind<br>
I climb up-after knowing you are safe</p><br>

<p>
Underneath the surface we only have the choices we made<br>
outcomes from options-<br>
doorways in a shifting architecture </p><br>

<p>
We navigate to find each other <br>
sometimes the framing holds- <br>
us captive<br>
-we imagine, we convince ourselves-<br>
punishable by conceiving<br>
-that no reason did contain us</p><br>

<p>
I will stamp my foot and bring about an earthquake<br>
before I choose to leave you, <br>
before I climb the ladder and do not stop <br>
when reaching top the trees-<br>
I will enter chaos-<br>
I will drive crazy madness<br>
emptying the air-out the windows<br>
blowing smoke extinguishing the fire <br>
colliding down stare-cases</p><br>

<p>
The demolished hill-side<br>
the screams of un-dead voices<br>
their movement in the shadows<br>
longing voices, flashing lights<br>
blue-lights, siren red and yellow<br>
headlights, red, green  - and yellow<br>
and those that radiate soothing rainbows<br>
of colors in  a slow precession, a hypnotic beckon<br>
-to set the battle, to wake the warriors, <br>
-to predict the future <br>
while all the time fire-works exploding </p><br>

<p>
 -Cast shells and make sacrifices<br>
orient by signs and symbols<br>
approximate the space with tokens<br>
   - draw- out the cosmos in the sand<br>
-command the ears to listen<br>
-place the relics on the alter<br>
 -and rise - a mountain top<br>
attain redeeming, enlightened power<br>
command the air to clear</p><br>

<p>
 All is still surfaces and noises and looks and stares<br>
  -and movement beneath the skin breathing in<br>
  -rhythm yet breathless, yet gasping<br>
 choking and drowning</p><br>

<p>
  Now dangling off balconies, wavering<br>
   - and blowing prayers off into<br>
   the night over roads and rooftops and across<br>
   -  the water</p><br>

<p>
  Tear down tapestries and installations of<br>
   -memories unfold blow out candles and<br>
   -away the ashes down stairs slam-door<br>
  hold back tears and do not extinguish the fire<br>
   - which burns the rooms behind</p><br>
