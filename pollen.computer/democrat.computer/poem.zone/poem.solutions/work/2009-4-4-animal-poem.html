<p>
I saw you as a lion when no more on the plains existed,<br>
I was transfixed, yet only for a moment <br>
you were really there - after all<br>
 -in between the trees and branches </p><br>

<p>
Ghosts do not drink cool waters <br>
of the forests- which are no more wild -<br>
your roar let fear untamed out across the open air-<br>
attain a single chord and sound unheard tones resound-</p><br>

<p>
sustain your might, your roaring fire, retain its flickering <br>
as if you, lion, are generating the far off stars-<br>
for we are cutting losses for what they really are...<br>
the nameless now is named, tree by tree and leaf by leaf</p><br>

<p>
Remain unchanged, unaltered, as I remember, would be deception, <br>
We have lost those valleys, rivers waterfalls and green<br>
Knotted twisted ferociously engaged and intertwined </p><br>

<p>
Come to the fore, my lion, were the forest meets the waters<br>
where the sunlight dances and plays the solstices and equinoxes  <br>
-Where are you, lion, now?     Have you lost your battle?<br>
I saw you as a lion when no more on the plains existed-</p><br>
