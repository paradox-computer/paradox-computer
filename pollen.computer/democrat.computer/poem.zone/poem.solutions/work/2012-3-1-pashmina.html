<p>
language: so speak and seep words</p><br>

<p>
understand and seek the new creation <br>
his creation:<br>
her </p><br>

<p>
be and lie in new places, <br>
wineglasses smash off balconies<br>
- to be drowned out by shouts and ejaculations of gratitude <br>
fireworks in the mind <br>
speak laugh and drive all night: lover bridge in the morning <br>
- lie and be told dismay<br>
so serious muscles <br>
don't take too seriously
Time passes lives over un-slowly <br>
sprouts of fruit bear fruitâ€™s success <br>
an we eat with <br>
and we eat <br>
and we eat our own lonely <br>
So, but smile</p><br>

<p>
we eat and we eat <br>
- lemon trees somewhere grow<br>
and live in orchards</p><br>

<p>
don'tarkness, and in this light age,  darkness<br>
behind- which are the summer trees, white forests, untouched wood<br>
a thousand million places</p><br>

<p>
move me, unsound side-ways undue-under warm blankets <br>
cover them, turn off the lights in the early morning<br>
dance with them <br>
push back the night, with force for to cover the morning<br>
sit-down my friend<br>
stand when we leave again</p><br>

<p>
decide artistically which are real <br>
dance<br>
-  &nbsp;lights, <br>
hotel-rooms<br>
curtains, decisions, long lines<br>
healing by cutting </p><br>

<p>
at that thin margin just waves across the water<br>
bubbles over the edge<br>
keep it going why not <br>
the monster <br>
the eyes of sex </p><br>

<p>
no worries no frighten over sorrow hallways <br>
cool winter hover over above <br>
a new again <br>
grins in the artificial <br>
light of morning <br>
push the night back over<br>
hills -curv -water<br>
night and day dance over her's horizon <br>
so push on day night! </p><br>
