<p>
I love you I realize:<br>
how come when you smiled I fell for you?<br>
for no-one ever made emotion show <br>
explode across my face before<br>
and I am not just signifying it the cover of an empty jar.</p><br>

<p>
-like the sky reached the ground <br>
&nbsp; - where trees stand <br>
there they learned how to reach the wind.<br>
&nbsp; - They stretch their leaves, for all the higher the more the sun warms them.<br>
&nbsp; All the higher to the sky they reach and the wind does blow them,<br>
&nbsp; signifying the connection between the earth and sky.  <br>
&nbsp; - Be it fair that the sun did rise today and shot down <br>
like a hail of arrows,<br>
- rays to the ground. </p><br>

<p>
- &nbsp;Thrown by the sun-<br>
they illuminate the sour and uneven earth<br>
- over which sentience does climb.  <br>
Yet it is not fairly like the sun rises that fortune threw you to me.<br>
&nbsp; - you are fair; and fairly speak I can <br>
that you bring justice, peace, as surely as that of which you dispose<br>
- my lip into a smile.   </p><br>

<p>
Be fair my love,<br>
&nbsp; that you are more than I can make you out to be<br>
- for when I close my eyes  so you are their  <br>
yet so unlike those dreams which cover over you<br>
- uncover you 
crawl in
- and you and I feel whole, solid ground, <br>
cleared of air of that which haunts you<br>
- I will stop it, for that which pains you I will take care of,<br>
- rid of, organize, and align.  </p><br>

<p>
- &nbsp;Our solid ground we will cover over <br>
like the sky does cover, embrace, and illuminate air, clouds- <br>
rain and wind, and tickle over all the leaves</p><br>
