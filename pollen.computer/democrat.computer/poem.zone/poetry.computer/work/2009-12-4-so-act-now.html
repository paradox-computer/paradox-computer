<p>
To realize means to create:<br>
So I was dreaming <br>
I was trying to save you from a bad-life<br>
the kind that haunts my sleep at night<br>
but no good-life I can provide you</p><br>

<p>
-but you're not the one who waits awake,<br>
you try<br>
and you succeeded and I am proud of you <br>
but what you have is not always the one you want<br>
so at the end of the day<br>
>&nbsp; when you go to fall asleep <br>
when it comes down to something you can count on <br>
I don't think there's anything at all<br>
(I am the dark)</p><br>

<p>
I tried the best that I had to try for <br>
nothing can give back to me <br>
the million tons of chemicals that my brain had to make<br>
those pathways I wired <br>
but if they change and I forget <br>
I am the only one who knows how hard it itâ€™s to be<br>
don't hesitate to stop and change your course<br>
the world will not wait<br>
your time, made with the most, of what you got<br>
it could be great <br>
a little bit of this and that <br>
and spark it up <br>
roll it out parade <br>
again and over and<br>
you'll be there <br>
and you'll be afraid <br>
and we will always be there <br>
and the feeling will subdue you<br>
from the ashes we will rise up and take our place<br>
for the rest of time <br>
usher in the new age paradigm <br>
it won't be there if we wait,<br>
so, act now!</p><br>
