<p>
didn't it sound great- all that new star?<br>
you might as well abate those dreams are wrong </p><br>

<p>
might as well have not sung that song at all</p><br>

<p>
it's not always the case of the bad start <br>
a second chance will not always make it any better </p><br>

<p>
I hold your hand as we move all but I never get you back<br>
like a time machine<br>
and it doesn't seem to me like a tragedy<br>
but I thought I lost it all<br>
I will think of you for a while my friend <br>
I would have let you go back a hero <br>
I never thought about why I had broken over <br>
never wrong never think about itâ€™s a step you're on too hard </p><br>

<p>
it seems like all you want is a love song <br>
yet you don't hear what you need<br>
you're never gonna be there as the band starts <br>
you are never gonna let the fights stop </p><br>

<p>
it's a dream when you and I say the same words oh it's a frenzy I say<br>
can't you can't help yourself my sweet friends you need this <br>
where you even now you seemingly escaping <br>
twitter twitch I don't care<br>
what do you think I am made of my friend <br>
I'd love to hear you sing a fool's song<br>
I would love to hear your -why it's wrong </p><br>
