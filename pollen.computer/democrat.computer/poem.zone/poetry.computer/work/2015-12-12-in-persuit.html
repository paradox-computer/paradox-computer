<p> 
"This... is... not... home!"<br>
I cry unto the sea.<br>
And yet, if familiarity exists at all,<br>
then it lies there<br>
between each wave.<br>
For in each drop of ice cold truth<br>
I've shed my tears.<br>
In all my years<br>
I've not returned.<br>
And though I've lived in eighteen houses,<br>
none of them...was home.</p><br>
 
<p>
The mist is rising from the water now<br>
and with it rises my unrest.<br>
My life has been one giant quest for peace,<br>
yet I have failed.<br>
The voices beckon me again.<br>
"Come home," they plead.<br>
If they but knew of all my vain attempts.<br>
My home lies on the shore.<br>
Of this I'm certain.<br>
But what shore?  Where?<br>
With each wrong turn, I find myself no closer.<br>
Yet moving, for a while, appeases me.<br>
Perhaps it's just the newness.<br>
For it takes time...<br>
to learn you don't belong.</p><br>
 
<p>
"This is not home!"<br>
I cry unto the sea.<br>
And somewhere deep inside of me...I know.<br>
I shall not find my coastal paradise within this life.<br>
But tomorrow...<br>
I will pack my bag and leave.<br>
Perhaps a little further south,<br>
where the air is warmer.<br>
A place where nostalgia reigns for a brief time.<br>
For any reprieve is welcome to a heart that screams,<br>
"This ...is... not... home!"</p><br>
