<p>
well I'd like to hear you say it's alright <br>

well I'd like to hear you say I can’t be forgotten  <br>

well I'd like to hear you say you're sorry for last night<br>

well I'd like to hear you say you won’t leave for a long time<br>

well I'd like to hear you say our problems are over<br>

well I'd like to hear you say I will be there in the morning <br>

well I'd like to hear you say never stand all of them up like the soldiers<br>

well I'd like to hear you say your dreams are not over <br>

well I'd like to hear you say you're repeating yourself now<br>

well I'd like to hear you say i'm coming over for the weekend<br>

well I'd like to hear you say you're there in my dreams and...<br>

well I'd like to hear you say: you thought you were forsaken<br>

well I'd like to hear you say who cares about our antecedent agreement <br>

well I'd like to hear you say it was worth it for a while<br>

well I'd like to hear you say you can imagine how to value<br>

well I'd like to hear you say don't go away again<br>

well I'd like to hear you say we're not just staying together<br>

I will lose you if I don't try<br>

well I'd like to hear you say I want there to be secrets<br>

we share <br>

well I'd like to hear you say there's nothing to do<br>

but get in bed for the rest of the day<br>

well I'd like to hear you say <br>

there's something moving for the better part now<br>

well I'd like to hear you say what you mean there's no explanation for them just the stories<br>

well I'd like to hear you say that because I meant so much you you had to leave but it was a mistake<br>
