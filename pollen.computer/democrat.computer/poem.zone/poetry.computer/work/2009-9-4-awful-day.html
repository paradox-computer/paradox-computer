		<h2 class="select">Awful day:</h2>&nbsp;
		<p style="text-align:right">September 4th  2009</p>


<p>
This day was awful.    <br>
Awful, it is the only word that I can say to describe it. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Awful- like the rain is; from a cloud,  <br>
it cannot be blamed when it comes and doesn't. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yet, so awful is a drought.  So, but untimely storms sweep us away, <br>
 down the hillsides and racing into lakes, oceans, or up into the air.   </p><br>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	Day by day, as some ceremonies require smoke, others hill sides, some paper money, sheets to hold the prayers: <br> 
 We are the benefactors of the ceremonies we commence, whatever they are for.   <br>
 &nbsp; This is the beginning of something now and until the end of the coherent account of it can be given. <br>
 &nbsp; This ceremony, today- begins with water, by lakes the thousand tons that is their bodies. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;    So-like the rain is this one day; it hangs in the air, it forms tributaries- <br>
 the streams of thought that flow out to fill a lake, they feed the oceans <br>
 &nbsp; The water came from the life here and is the feeling that today brought me.</p><br>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	What grows up has been touched by the light of the sun.    <br>
 It is star-light that sun is and I wish it to have the consciousness it allows for.    <br>
 The sun is owed recognition, it lacks a self too.   <br>
 what we love here cannot be let go of even if it cannot speak and has no self.  <br>
&nbsp;  The rain cannot speak or tell a story but my storm can speak <br>
It is when I am sleeping and when I am in the morning it is all that life treats me to. </p><br>  

<p>
I will fall from this life hand in hand with the next one.<br>
Will your hand lead me there?<br>
Will you follow with me to the end?<br>
For if you -wave your hand, I will follow you to where does take you out to go.  <br>
Do you see it - you - are waters, lakes, the oceans if I am standing on the side of you.  <br>
I may be standing on solid grounds but you are the waters that I speak to when I pray, when I wash or when I commit to ash <br>some paper money so to ceremoniously pay, for you, your body of fresh or salty, vapor or ice; you are the water.  </p><br>
