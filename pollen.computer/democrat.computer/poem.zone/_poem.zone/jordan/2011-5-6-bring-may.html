You'll try your best to stop them but all they are are thieves <br> 
You're under all their spell now<br> 
what's wrong what's wrong  there's no one for you to love <br> 
they are just vagaries<br> 
When you try to stop them they never try to flee<br> 
it's hard to charge them for what can't be seen<br> 
and there is not one among them?<br> 
I'm not your shining star  -man <br> 
you won't get me too far away</p><br> 

<p>
how come you just let me fall away.</p><br> 

<p>
maybe the wind will blow this town away <br> 
storms have come to this valley </p><br> 

<p>
you know the way home <br> 
let's have a few words we will say <br> 
one moment after our hope passes, here I am-<br> 
- I think it's the story we debate over.</p><br>
