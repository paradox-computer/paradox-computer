<p>
Spoken softly never reaching my ear <br>
-sounds over again and over repeat,<br>
-I only wish, your words I might once hear </p><br>

<p>
Being no longer a dream - crystal clear-<br>
feeling the woof, the texture of defeat-<br>
Spoken softly, never reaching my ear </p><br>

<p>
As if your figure stands both far and near <br>
I saw you standing on the wild street,<br>
I only wish- your words I might once hear</p><br>

<p>
As I slowly blinked, you did disappear <br>
-flesh, stone and steel longing to be concrete<br>
-Spoken softly, never reaching my ear </p><br>

<p>
Waiting for -a solid shape to appear-<br>
you left me suspended yet incomplete<br>
-I only wish your words I might once hear </p><br>

<p>
Vibrations animate your darkest fear-<br>
-bring me to life!  I dare not miss a beat-<br>
Spoken softly never reaching my ear-<br>
I only wish your words I might once hear </p><br>
