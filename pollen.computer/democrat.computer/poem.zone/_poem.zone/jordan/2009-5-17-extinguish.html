<p>
Forever realized by nothing but ash and electricity,<br>
water and sunlight and my paper<br>
ground of being <br>
rest in certainty </p><br>
<p>
Dead and be buried,<br>
or grown into something different <br>
Evermore bloodless residue <br>
colorless and non-human<br>
odorless, spiritless and blanched<br>
baked bleach and snow-blindness bright<br>
broken down crushed into vapor</p><br>
<p>
Respire something, take a breath <br>
suddenly and on one's own accord <br>
tend to the fire that puts forth the light<br>
so we can see and be warm </p><br>
<p>
Did the wind you meet?<br>
Did you catch a storm on a ship at sea?<br>
Lean into my ear, you can speak to me<br>
If you need, I will orate for you;<br>
lay shadows behind me if you are the light I see-</p><br>
<p>
Would be lost but I find you<br>
would be but are saved.<br>
would have been willed to be destroyed<br>
But god did not smile, you did</p><br>
<p>
I betray only myself now<br>
the birds do not move any more <br>
they flap their wings, <br>
caught immobile in a breeze</p><br>
<p>
Time and space be and so be caught up<br>
twisted and bent out of line<br>
alone by the sun, by the water the moon<br>
let alone by you and by me. <br>
did our frames not cascade? <br>
did our metaphors coincide?</p><br>
<p>
I am here to see the sun with you<br>
the moon can be our child <br>
the stars can be<br>
our eyes<br>
other matters far out of reach<br>
yet they reach to me<br>
and they signify you<br>
 -here on this planet <br>
I will find you<br>
when the sun rises and the moon sets<br>
when the stars are right<br>
aligned to the ash in me</p><br>
<p>
the ground at my feet was spinning before it even coalesced <br>
 -from whence it was dust<br>
there we were, there we met<br>
Here we have always been </p><br>
<p>
How you left me soft spoken	 <br>
In a valley with a gossamer mist <br>
that was pain to me
my deepest fear is that it will pain forever you too</p><br>
<p>
the rain began falling to bring in the night<br>
extinguish the fire the warmth and the light </p><br>
