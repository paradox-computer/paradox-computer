<p>
What is meant to be shall be, <br>
so be careful for that you play some part in it- </p><br> 

<p>
For what part you play in it<br>
we, that is you and I shall see<br>
we shall see which are dreams <br>
and which are possibilities: <br>
remember what will be shall be forever- <br>
how you make it out to be<br>
&nbsp; -be and go- <br>
your way shall be as it was before you<br>
lay it down, what is in the past now<br>
play with your ideas and words<br>
arrange them how you desire them to go to the last measure<br>
to the final measure<br>
by no more a measure than the means before<br>
and that - that you can remember <br>
and all that is en-caption<br>
and all that atmosphere suspended <br>
over and about the lake and mountain ran the shore-</p><br> 

<p>
by more brilliant light we make them <br>
outlines and cast about your dreams are mind<br>
possibilities remember that never before<br>
I saw you<br>
and you did dispose me to smile<br>
more than I needed to but not enough <br>
for when you were gone<br>
only I remember <br>
for you did not cause it in me the longing to know (you)</p><br> 

<p>
ark seconds pass, go by, fall, minute by minute</p><br>
