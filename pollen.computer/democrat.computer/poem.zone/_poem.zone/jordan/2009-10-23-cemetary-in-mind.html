<p>
I can see you are the rain that falls at night<br>
I can see it -you are moonlight<br>
that reflection on the dew; the grass,<br>
cool beneath our feet</p><br>

<p>
Itâ€™s the hallow edge of time <br>
tick the hour clock and go away you<br>
I need it not be beckoned forth<br>
for this reason:<br>
humans were born here<br>
humans died and were buried <br>
the stone's mass toss and turn <br>
-[even they cannot stand forever]</p><br>

<p>
I want you to go out<br>
burn up -so that you feel no loss in feeling's less<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  the earth will shake the sun will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; rise up- over again and over, <br>
Where will you be- out there?</p><br>

<p>
I will not let you be forgotten<br>
&nbsp; so when you die<br>
our memories will not be<br>
left to the rubble that cannot keep<br>
-no names that wash away<br>
-no noises<br>
-no moss and earth raised up<br>
-no one-hundred years spent after we die<br>
-living not in children<br>
-no-<br>
beings not there- nor will you<br>
come again as <br>
running animals or something awful <br>
-your life - if you give me <br>
your hand- will be<br>
as I give you my hand <br>
&nbsp; -in the here and now<br>
And so forth will we live in this moment<br>
until the sun fails to rise<br>
the moon fails to set:<br>
for a hundred years long winter waits behind</p><br>

<p>
--------------------------------------</p><br>

<p>
Raise from the ground<br>
&nbsp; all those who are gone <br>
for fear them not<br>
they are so let them be-<br>
for all they are I know they are- <br>
their apparatus reach above the ground</p><br>

<p>
This place is a grave land<br>
lights flash to illuminate the <br>
sour and uneven earth<br>
interspersed strangely small trees </p><br>

<p>
I have not the strength to move against it <br>
the metaphysics are not mine<br>
but in them I share with you,</p><br>

<p>
I can not be more further from your eyes than you make me out to be and go, <br>
predicate where I go with your mind<br>
an you follow me out there because for what feeling were you looking for?</p><br>

<p>
What but the sensation that is the circumstance of our commotion <br>
that your mind follows me-<br>
I track you with my dreams at night<br>
and am ready for when in you are there<br>
I will shroud you in the metaphysics <br>
that cloak the stars <br>
though they be it not your body<br>
- though they be it not some dreams <br>
I will move over, trace you, when mention to me </p><br>

<p>
my metaphysics <br>
Let be what will change you<br>
for all that I <br>
know your there <br>
when the rain came and the  moon-light shown you <br>
thought that before that if it fails you now <br>
you will only widen your eyes more<br>
before that <br>
dawn came </p><br>

<p>
Let me elaborate with what strength I have left, my metaphysics.</p><br>

<p>
I will not end this- a sad story<br>
I won't look at you any more but you're not dead<br>
you're who I imagine and so we never speak<br>
and what tells me you are there ?<br>
I see your smile, I see your lips part, you face at me<br>
this is too good to be not some dream - a sad feeling</p><br>

<p>
your metaphysical to me <br>
your a story that I tell myself <br>
it's not fair that nothing's there<br>
so, less, this moment passes <br>
it's you and I who let it go-</p><br>
