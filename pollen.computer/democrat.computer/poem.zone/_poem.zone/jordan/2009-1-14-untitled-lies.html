<p>
Know my broken heart lies, destined to be. <br>
So, but all the trying should never have been undertaken<br>
For the outcome would have been the same.</p><br>

<p>
Remain unchanged. Unaltered. As I remember. <br>
Would be deception... As it occurs, the difficulty is in seeing the grammar and <br>noticing the rules that govern. <br>
After, the difficulty is forgetting the pattern as it happened. </p><br>

<p>
Reverberations of an echo  <br>
being the fabric of dreams <br>
Extends and stretch out the void red darkness <br>
forever-over again and over</p><br>

<p>
Being unsatisfied, left a broken record, <br>
unattended to as-if forgotten.<br>
there still is music, a melody to happen. <br>
It does not take a bold lover to show and reveal <br>
in order to see everything unfolding<br>
that is now cloaked in darkness <br>
and hardly shown </p><br>

<p>
Realize all along those few moments where everything<br>
and at the same time realize what it means to be a human  </p><br>

<p>
Almost dying, coming close to the edge  <br>
only to see the same vision <br>
of being in a dream</p><br>

<p>
So where is the edge of this dagger? <br>
- where will the red blood drips reveal?<br>
remember being frightened by trains<br>
remember leaving something valuable behind<br>
lost only to be found<br>
stolen, only to remember and have forever. </p><br>

<p>
Know my broken heart lies, destined to be. <br>
So, but also know why I keep it hidden <br>
somewhere that I think is safe but isn't.</p><br>


<p>
Know my heart lies broken, jumbled.<br>
As it always has-happened before </p><br>

<p>
So, with its breaking, <br>
no-longer generating within me fire, <br>
cutting losses for what they really are, <br>
ropes to far off stars</p><br>

<p>
Connections that will never again happen <br>
as they were transcendent and only for a moment <br>
in the here and now.</p><br>

<p>
We all will continue like clockwork <br>
We all will age gracefully<br>
We all will find lovers whom we do not know now<br>
and do not expect to ever find.<br>
Notice things that have been there <br>
all along and bear witness to life happening<br>
and lighting up our faces in the far off distant future<br>
- and in the far off distant past, <br>
like burning shadows </p><br>
