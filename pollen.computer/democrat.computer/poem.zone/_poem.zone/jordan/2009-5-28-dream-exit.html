<p>
How with you I long to be<br>
-fade not into other shadows?<br>
Make a dream of life as dream at night<br>
for when I awaken you are not there</p><br>

<p>
Make life a dream so when I wake<br>
I need not dream to have you<br>
dream to lose, to steal, to find<br>
When only I awaken having lost something<br>
some impression which hardly compels me to <br>
Jump up<br>
Wake up<br>
out of bed into cold morning climb<br>
sometimes I race to sleep so that I can deceive myself </p><br>

<p>
Can’t thou see my heart ache<br>
-feel my darkest fear?<br>
what is empathy towards other people cannot touch the<br>
waves across this water that need one single frequency <br>
one amplitude to harmonize them.</p><br>

<p>
Can’t thou see- even if I draw your eyes<br>
you need not eyes to understand<br>
For I don’t see you and you don’t see me<br>
Can’t thou hear- I will convey to you<br>
Interoperate and orate for you <br>
All I need is for you to be not but a figure of speech <br>
Speak to me!  <br>
Move with me like autumn day light plays and dances with the colors<br>
the enriching of the leaves<br>
So, show me colors <br>
So, pass like seasons and only fortify them <br>
collaborate to signify their happening<br>
so one season follows from another- <br>
when there is no need to look back<br>
no need for sorrow until the last day<br>
For when aligned right, each day happens <br>
only so to be a platform of and for the next step<br>
on a great move forward</p><br>
