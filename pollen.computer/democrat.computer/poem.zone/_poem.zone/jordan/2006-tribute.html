		<p style="text-align:right">Spring 2006</p>

These words are about you and I-<br>
It is in the sense where I'll rely<br>
on you, to put a watch on naked time<br>
to make some sense of absent rhyme<br>
to pick up memories from where they lie<br>
like a thousand shards of glass-</p><br>

<p>
Under the weight of ocean and sea and sorrowful rain<br>
jagged edges have been made tame.<br>
Further from shore, they can't be searched for-<br>
past's language is foreign, I know it no more.<br>
Where the waves crash- the end of a December<br>
this is the point that we'll start to remember.</p><br>

<br>
<p>
That winter, the snowflakes fell like pianos and were revealed in cacophony-<br>
No longer tossing and turning in the sleep of days, awakened by the crashing in our ears<br>
and the jolting shudder of Life picking up to Go-<br>
Racing a countdown started on New Years and driven mad by the ticking seconds<br>
at least I was, you were always burning cool in comparison,<br>
but with the same electricity crackling under your fingertips-</p><br>

<p>
Breath smoking, words billowing out<br>
talking eternally breathlessly occasionally pausing eyes flashing effervescence<br>
trailing streams of conversation from packed cars as we whizzed over roadways<br>
plunging over hills going seventy on ice and dirt and gasping turns-<br>
Everything was new and everything was loud and everything was delirious,<br>
Rhapsody was found by the cash machine in the 7/11<br>
and we touched our palms to cement walls in Harmony, gazing at the future-<br>
the snow itself melted in rapture-</p><br>

<p>
Do you recall what's impossible to capture?</p><br>

<p>
Soon, summer eased in,<br>
Sonorous bell tones suffused the air with calm<br>
The hours slunk by, lazy and long-<br>
Everything unwound a little in the heat, you and I included,<br>
we drifted around each other, distracted and distant<br>
Neither of us minded much when I went away-<br>
I wondered if the quiet was here to stay.<br>
But what I'd thought was quiet was actually the hum of expectation-<br>
you heard it of course, in your vibrant eyes I saw anticipation-</p><br>

<p>
and then finally, the world burst open;<br>
like a ripe fruit splattering sweetness over our days,<br>
the taste making us giddy but the sun slowing the rush and<br>
dizzying everyone with its golden tessellations except you,<br>
who could only smile more than I'd ever seen<br>
ambling through hours as I shivered over silver puddles in Keene-</p><br>

<p>
you saw perfection in time's suspension,<br>
and even when the days lost brilliance, we didn't think<br>
they had been lost to the Fall-</p><br>

<p>
they were, after all-<br>
achingly, wretchedly, the sun cracked to pieces,<br>
its fractured rays in splinters on the ground-<br>
on a Friday<br>
I heard the shattering sound -<br>
when her phone rang and she answered loudly before frozen quiet spread across her face,<br>
Framed, like always, by a fiery halo.</p><br>

<p>
Now we took refuge in locked rooms the only places that weren't hollow-<br>
Sitting by your art and<br>
kicking  dust ball hopes across the floor and<br>
making lists of what we cared about-</p><br>
<br>
<p>
Feeling fit for nowhere and nothing else except God's Alley:<br>
Brick sacrilegious space<br>
rain falling on our heads as we listened through walls to voices sing<br>
echoes of hymns and thoughts resounding Up-<br>
towards and about something that had always been gone,<br>
(Except for the wire angels that you made<br>
Knotted and twisted, ferocious and forgotten in my backyard,<br>
only for believers and mothers to find)-</p><br>
<br>

<p>
Lost cause lost hopes lost paradise-<br>

<p>
Where are those fluorescent nights?<br>
Where are the ancient railroads with their terrifying train surprise?<br>
Where are the girls with dirty jeans and vengeance songs and angry crying eyes?<br>
Where are the secret morning rooftops the smooth river bones the winding cemetery mazes the Sid Vicious posters and exploding balloon crazes?</p><br>

<p>
Why would they ask if we realize, realize<br>
warning the consequences of a compromise but<br>
not understanding why only the ashes have stayed alive?</p><br>

<p>
The ashes- the only things burning since the sun broke,<br>
They soar out car windows in pentatonic scale mornings and<br>
visit that ancient railroad then follow, to where<br>
rust balances over water, where<br>
you and I are searching for pieces of blue glass-<br>
where the ashes dust our eyelashes and<br>
we blink,<br>
on the last note of requiem-</p><br>

<p>
You and I,<br>
We ricochet off the boundaries of this school, this town,<br>
A thousand reverberations sounding in our skulls after the impact<br>
But again, always again<br>
We slam our cards down unto the table<br>
Borrowing each other's luck and<br>
Crossing our fingers when there is no more. <br>
These words are about you and I-<br>
It is in the sense where I'll rely<br>
On you, to understand the shift of time<br>
and know the feeling behind my rhyme.<br>
to pick up memories from where they lie<br>
like a thousand shards of glass</p><br>
