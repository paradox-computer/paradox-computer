<p>
Take out not some damage piece of thorn<br>
- but a child, something whole <br>
- don't know what's coming<br>
but who can<br>
know what you want from a long life?  <br>
Who can't land that?<br>
who goes around and names things and to say it only<br>
- makes us see - that way </p><br>

<p>
WHO WROTE names and  NUMBERS ON CIGARETTES, YOUR CALLING CARD, LIKE A TEST<br>
hatch-mark<br>
hatch-mark<br>
-destroy tissue-</p><br>

<p>
Oh, &nbsp; running water-<br>
who caught the communicable diseases:<br>
freedom and equality<br>
- globally became endemic<br>
banned encampment -how you hummed!  may never see and hear again <br>
never again seeing the bang -encampment humming<br>
blue smoke <br>
enjambment </p><br>
<br>
<p>
all your dreams were cherished by me<br>
all your uplift spirits raised mine<br>
this machine does-warm as the dawn breaks the night <br>
where you and I sleep and jostled by the movement wake <br>
the pendulum <br>
climbing staircases to sit atop a fort/tree/ss of wonder<br>
waves their hand over bodies sought to heal them <br>
who took to the streets like bandits<br>
played music with paint and conjured images<br>
drove vans to outreach to flower beds <br>
who bravely took to buildings like their static swing didn't frighten <br>
too, took to bridges, battled over water, <br>
oh metropolis, shutter all you-  windows tight. <br>
- metropolitan romantic eyed gaze,<br>
- shaken platform streets <br>
so be radical! <br>
that ultimate discourse<br>
- higher than the codified language of our predecessors <br>
or their sacred texts  <br>
one truth I do welcome<br>
please tell me (the truth)<br>
- because you were<br>
who will be with you?<br>
that repetition sheathed <br>
you will be waiting for: tone <br>
thing to come back... you never had saved </p><br>
<br>
<p>
the subway tracks sparkles at night<br>
- hope dreamers are made,<br>
The water that runs between the tracks of the g train <br>
runs towards church ave.<br>
- the tiles of the floor come up like game tokens<br>
And the bank vault glistens<br>
all visitors and travelers<br>
lay your sleeping bags over flower beds<br>
-you can’t say no to a millionaire- <br>
And the cops line up but they are just birds on a wire<br>
rubber bullets and smoke cans point blank<br>
well that’s how this story goes<br>
Ya! Well we've seen it our whole life</p><br>
<br>
<p>
those echo voices and new strange expression of sound<br>
as there hung heros and faces which are dying to be familiar <br>
and those who humbled themselves up <br>
scribbling on their arms 212 679 6018</p><br>

<p>
the new government, seeing first life, in these covert cells, slowly progressing <br>
for when it comes down to having absolutely nothing<br>
- you either are or you are not in that boat . And the people here are saying, we are all in one boat and absolutely we have something: togetherness. </p><br>

<P>
laws are you saying:<br>
when you are eaten by the monster, dead, in its stomach, <br>
that is when it knows where you are absolutely...</p><br>

<P>
pragmatics, the sun of all your glow fallen rye<br>
-feel it all the time now-<br>
come up for you have fallen back <br>
What do we take into our own hands?: <br>
the old organism with growing new organs<br>
well that’s how this story goes<br>
ya well we've seen it our whole life</p><br>
<br>
<p>
-the air beneath out reached wings which are still <br>
- and the creature with winds is intangible like a mist <br>
and still <br>
like the snapshot of an explosion.  <br>
-and who so quickly go <br>
- &nbsp; and who rode in circles the trains at night <br>
what meaningful exchanges came by under waves <br>
and would like the tide be transitional between force body, shaken  </p><br>
<br>
<p>
all the people shouting <br>
greet morning light and romantic eyes in bereavement together<br>
- hail the light for soon all by fire fall-<br>
&nbsp; -marching up the streets blocking traffic,<br>
&nbsp; -finding crowds and standing ground and shouting <br>
shouting and echoing from the microphone:<br>
- ideas and voices, anticipation, lies, nigh-mayors fear ecstasy loss-waiting for the break of morning <br>
for reinforcement<br>
- spitters and cursors and defectors and being surrounded, trapped netted in penned -- looked at with distaste  <br>
discontinuous groups take the night from outrŽ shoulders are a thousand triumphant nights oh nights lay low <br>
- oh discontinuous groups thou shall with all the power of the earth fall. <br> 
smile for you are bright and your romantic eyes are longing shimmers of that which only nothing for years has found you. <br>
- for broken like a window which looks onto the polis and polis shape<br>
&nbsp; -and you and I reflect that which it is governed by broken by the morning light and <br>
nothing you ever really want grows in desire <br>
who makes those choices in life plays with fire </p><br>

<P>
find the way home trace the outline  <br>
you worry out into your hand and trace the line home<br>
people you may not stop them but your right will<br>
as we stand proudly on the fundaments of a new nation <br>
these and henceforth people you are its cohort and its fundaments <br>
children of our mothers and our father nation passes.</p><br>

<p>
&nbsp; And though it seems like the torch of liberty -will be-<br>
- passed extinguished it is the blood which passes and infuses. </p><br>

<p>
town the torch, extinguished fire, the lady cry for hers was taken -<br>
her only sister, broken scales and blind, kidnapped, taken - her body<br>
- we will never find and all the world is shaken<br>
- And that darkness compels us <br>
into the light and venture where the fire burns so bright and faces, erected over,<br>
- and distinguished we rally and march over bridges, defectors,<br>
- and are humbled only by each other, and curse those hoofed animals screams shrills and <br>
please don't stop them the magistrate commands of them and nothing<br>
amongst them is saved, no-one is redeemed </p><br>

<p>
- becoming who will be there when you lose yours:</p><br>
- being </p><br>

<p>
drove deep underground like fire on the heel- to be -eruption, <br>
a liquid fire that hardens stone<br>
a fire that melts away and that on which he will walk, <br>
- for who are the stones beneath his feet, that grounds supports him. </p><br>
