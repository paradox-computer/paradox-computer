<p>
Where are you going to be-?<br>
I am coming for you<br>
oh brother, oh brother, oh brother of mine</p><br>

<p>
I have searched for you now, for such a long time <br>
oh brother, oh brother, oh brother of mine</p><br>

<p>
Where are you now?  &nbsp;across the great oceans<br>
are you far off at sea?<br>
From the distance come home-<br>
there I need you to see.</p><br>

<p>
There are tremors and storms, which are brewing<br>
pollution in water is stewing<br>
trickling, yet hardly seen</p><br>

<p>
&nbsp; -The acid rain plays requiem on<br>
&nbsp; -rooftops and in-between buildings-<br>
Inside all are our people<br>
&nbsp; -smother and dissolving - the nature outside</p><br>

<p>
There are no more wild- no more forests<br>
I am hardly surprised it didn't happen before. </p><br>

<p>
Sometimes I don't think itâ€™s worth how hard I tried<br>
Each day, each and every time I tried <br>
I tried to be a friend so as not to be alone again</p><br>

<p>
come on,  &nbsp;come on, I am alone again<br>
Welcome home!  well, come home<br>
Come on home so I can take care of you again</p><br>
