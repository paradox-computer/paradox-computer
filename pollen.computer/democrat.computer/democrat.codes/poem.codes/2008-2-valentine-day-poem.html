<p>
These words portfolio your eyes-<br>
your stare your glance arise-<br>
a city in the air, a gothic-<br>
romance flying mare --be the<br>
meter of my rhyme and know-<br>
I'm trying not to let you go<br>
inspire and desire to retain<br>
a prototype, a gift, a mighty-<br>
-blazing beacon fire</p><br>

<p>
glisten laughing exit pictures listen</p><br>


<p>
 - sapphire  memories- vibrant memories  glossy flood<br>
spontaneous dream combustions<br>
crackle and release unillustrated murmurs<br>
requiring paramnesia<br>
acquire dust yourself asleep</p><br>

<p>
-incarnate hopes and fears<br>
whose years pass by unknowing<br>
-whose tears cry spring are flowing<br>
trickling yet hardly seen<br>
through song and birds in flight<br>
through the branches shone at night<br>
the stars<br>
- away from the city<br>
far above the lake and darkness<br>
fractured rays of dancing shadows<br>
of tears which are no more wild<br>
no more forests</p><br>

<p>
places which once gleamed untouched<br>
un- trampled and untamed<br>
the nameless now is named<br>
- tree by tree and leaf by leaf</p><br>

<p>
passing days loose counts on dreams<br>
motions forever lost withdraw<br>
from the depths to carry content<br>
as stable captive as to photograph<br>
the human soul and map the cosmos</p><br>

As you embark, chased by darkness to manifest destinations<br>
as you suspend in animation breathe radio beams and vibrations<br>
 -radiating electrical charges crackle lightning clouds</p><br>

<p>
remember flash songs and pictures and well into the night and early morning<br>
phosphorescent dancing down streets framed by a halo green and yellow, pink, blue glow<br>
reminisce, retain those flickering iconic lyric description of a situation and state of<br>
affairs we telecast our own exposure our own impression we project</p><br>

<p>
witnessing atmospheric phenomenon anchor rings each others nimbus and aurora glory light<br>
and wings tornado<br>
weather and a state neither want and never want to leave</p><br>

<p>
attest to and encapsulate a token<br>
coalesced into an indirect request to<br>
concentrate condense enclose shut in<br>
a single moment to compare to what was<br>
never there -every day we have</p><br>

<p>
each twilight tide rise an epoch of chance an era of opportunity<br>
and a period of time between afternoon and high noon midday morning-<br>
time night noontide dawn<br>
 -breakfast dusk dinner and twilight tonight</p><br>

<p>
between you and I and the vastness and incomprehensibility between you and I we have a<br>
mardi gras of time yet unseen</p><br>

<p>
Wave your own hand waver touch the air<br>
look into the finite much is there<br>
but this I know is true an icon and<br>
true too much over used:<br>
you have but one arrow one bow<br>
one swift let go<br>
one reflection<br>
one painting<br>
one long photo</p><br>

<p>
we have but one life one chance<br>
to know that we are not alone<br>
we learn we only are<br>
the awful Truman show<br>
there was an awful rainbow once in heaven</p><br>

<p>
I only wish our lives will show<br>
the way to  what we desire to retain-<br>
a prototype, a gift, a mighty<br>
blazing beacon fire </p><br>
