<p>
red bird with one white wing<br>
sitting on the subway floor<br>
the hipster calls you just get it out mama <br>
cloths fall <br>
full moon <br>
one foot in the back yard the other foot in the city<br>
little room</p><br>

<p>
resin blackened teeth</p><br>

<p>
what doesn't become jostled?<br>
THE NEW LIFE<br>
the new life<br>
who conversed with the city as a brother<br>
plastic seats, wooden benches<br>
yes, the bottom of the ocean calls them<br>
here you are by why are your roads to and fro so<br>
constantly busy <br>
they pile in they pile out<br>
they disrupt you, brother<br>
you are frightened the roads are your tentacles<br>
I cannot come to you oh brother with nothing but what I carry <br>
I can’t trick the roads and take to the trains my bed and basket </p><br>

<br>
<p>
I couldn't say nothing I do not disrupt the solution to any problem <br>
if i could be silent   you would still know that you lost me <br>
because you chose to do so<br>
but now you know I know you know <br>
I put u in the list of those who didn't complete me <br>
who does not assign but keeps tabs on<br>
who slips beneath time<br>
fears the forward coming of the world<br>
places themselves there <br>
no-one<br>
nothing<br>
so alone</p><br>

<p>
you too gone<br>
too gone to save<br>
I'm not wasting my time over there where their body is sobers <br>
we your</p><br>

<p>
oh so long <br>
I was happy <br>
to see u again <br>
I would give anything <br>
to see u again<br>
like purgatory swallowed<br>
me up<br>
let me go let me go <br>
who's the judge here<br>
do I know him<br>
-do I know her <br>
she, the judge, oh</p><br>

<p>
what was I to say<br>
sorry baby your heart was just too broken up for me?<br>
if the solution is staring you in the face then what is staring you in the face..?</p><br>

<p>
you and i will have to wait.<br>
- it’s just like this worry i have<br>
then again it comes back when the wind comes</p><br>
