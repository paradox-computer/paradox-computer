<p>
baby got a place  |  got another heart beat<br>
I heard it pounding in the dark then<br>
but could not find it any longer</p><br>

<p>
baby I got away<br>
to feel another heart beat <br>
I fell awake into his arms and </p><br>

<p>
and I never thought it anyway but </p><br>

<p>
I would have waited here unto his heart beat</p><br>

<p>
I would have waited till he found out <br>
I don’t want him any longer </p><br>

<p>
But I would have said just listen to this heart beat<br>
You could have longed and followed all them </p><br>

<p>
And never really even known it <br>
Even though it was the strongest we don’t need it any longer </p><br>

<p>
It's just like dreaming it's just like all them. They don't really understand I'm on the beat 

<p>
never thought I would be    <br>
Can't crawl away from in your arms and <br>
Cannot fight it any longe</p><br>
