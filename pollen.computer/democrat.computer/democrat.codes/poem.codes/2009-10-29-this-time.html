<p>
I want more for you and I <br>
the charms fall like autumn leaves do<br>
catch them if you can<br>
-before they touch the ground and are just another leaf among them all</p><br>

<p>
Touch the ground! <br>
It will cast you-<br>
the way the ground feels <br>
to your hand <br>
is all the sensation that life may bring to you<br>
the commotion will bring-up a cloud of dust <br>
which will settle before the wind does catch you <br>
for you are the solid earth- fundament <br>
secured by bed-rock <br>
We will abate erosion on your grounds with gentle upkeep<br>
I will tend to you a garden for our needs<br>
-we can build channels for the streams <br>
the running water-fall<br>
 to enter tributaries <br>
that leave this hillside mountain behind</p><br>

<p>
You and I will see something in evocations <br>
reflecting the seasons <br>
they move over you and I</p><br>

<p>
we can take the roads out<br>
to go, <br>
see were the people are off to<br>
who passed on, whoâ€™s new -<br>
what is wrong out there <br>
we can draw attention to </p><br>

<p>
As I alluded to before, <br>
a new age will be built<br>
on the grounds that you touch <br>
you will bring about life there<br>
and we will bring about<br>
the infrastructure necessary-</p><br>

<p>
The principles and point up to something<br>
more than just this simple notion<br>
because when we die <br>
like a vegetable we go in back into the ground that <br>
we so took from all our lives-<br>
back into the earth we go <br>
and again we will bring about it, life<br>
not yours, not mine-<br>
-so, this life, hand in hand with the next one:<br>
is in principle unlike that which returns soil to the ground<br>
we are frozen in flight<br>
we are lost to what storms the world forever-<br>
So storm here!<br>
we can design a world and life that cannot wash away with time<br>
nothing can bring hell here,<br>
no breaking the world unto a night-mare </p><br>
