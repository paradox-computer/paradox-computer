<p>
As it extends to us- in our briefness -<br>
I am going to die at a young age, I can feel it as my heart and lungs degrade<br>
I can feel my bones all ache<br>
I no longer hesitate <br>
because probably I wonâ€™t die today<br>
as it extends to us in our briefness<br>
from that moment on we drift away<br>
like clouds that captured light  <br>
at sunset to juxtapose the stars and night-<br>
we coalesced at dusk and with the breeze did dissipate </p><br>

<p>
Try not to worry or slink into madness<br>
don't let sadness defeat you<br>
don't slip on your sanity</p><br>

<p>
Blink your eye, beauty spot, prussian blue<br>
scantily clad, unbeknown silhouette retreat through<br>
field of view </p><br>

<p>
I spend my time in quiet contemplation</p><br>
