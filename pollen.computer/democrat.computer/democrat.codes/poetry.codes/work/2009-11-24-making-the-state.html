<p>
Parse - break into<br>
- components to test conformability to <br>
a logical grammar;</p><br>
 
<p>
So, unholy grammar let out against each other <br>
using force to brighten, like the sunlight, what they say</p><br>

<p>
these words are about those who <br>
in their turn were left vulnerable to disease, want, and unattended old age <br>
was in them and left -welcome -<br>
this age, <br>
(the something new)</p><br>

<p>
This is how we found the pieces on the floor <br>
I know no one who knew what was being bargained for <br>
leave them to the floor, letâ€™s go<br>
let be<br>
they were broken before we got here<br>
-(have not we the strength to put them together; <br>
as they are they lay broken?) <br>
the pieces only signify what was the bargain and it was made and have not we the strength to move against it?<br>
the bargain and fate of the world.</p><br>

<p>
The bargain was made but the players are not there and in turn the game could be newly played&nbsp;.<br>
you and I have but to find a few more players and sit down in their chairs<br>
so to we can begin to revision this nightmare</p><br>
