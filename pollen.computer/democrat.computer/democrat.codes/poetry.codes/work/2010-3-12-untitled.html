<p>
Do not fear them they are sleeping</p><br>
 
<p>
Lets try to fall asleep<br>
be where we dream<br>
before we think about what haunts our life</p><br>

<p>
What had meaning to be said for a long time <br>
I tried to wait for you to fall asleep again before I cried</p><br>

<p>
Like a sorrowful dream I thought would come back to haunt me in a awaking time<br>
I knew you were out there on the street <br>
walking back from where you came from<br>
it must have been a dream memory <br>
for your lying here next to me in my bed</p><br>

<p>
I know you are leaving tomorrow and I will feel the way I felt there on the street<br>
It won't be so in between real and fake tomorrow </p><br>

<p>
You will rise <br>
I know you’re not running from me-<br>
but you are running to someplace <br>
I can not compete with that which I do not know<br>
I can’t compete with you<br>
wake up - tell me what your dreams are made of </p><br>
