<p>
who wants children <br>
who longs for that explanation<br>
who knew one and who knew another language <br>
you lay down <br>
what is like my life for me<br>
who are intimate with another<br>
who are intimate with<br>
that after wedding smell that fume<br>
TO GET IN TO OR OUT OF THE BUSINESS<br>
take someone up on their offer</p><br>

<p>
I just want to kiss your lips<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  both small round parts-  a breath of fresh air<br>
because their is terror you inspire me<br>
because there is like a candle in a dark night <br>
one single chance to see<br>
something new <br>
because yes I've been waiting to experience<br>
to change To prove my self and others wrong because I forgot this then<br>
because I forgot this then <br>
and then you.  <br>
you are one in a deck of cards <br>
I want to go away with you<br>
I want you to feel absolutely safe with me<br>
don't tell<br>
but</p><br>
