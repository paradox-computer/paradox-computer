<p>
- how come you're down on your knees<br>
how come you can't get up on your feet<br>
I just tried to get up early and make the morning something</p><br>

<p>
make your motion<br>
pour your gasoline right on the road<br>
and fill your tank again<br>
you won't hear that one from me again <br>
no<br>
you look like you're afraid but you're just alone</p><br>

<p>
little timing takes the motion drives them home </p><br>

<p>
list of things to take <br>
trash, cloths from the floor, all my thoughts of you.<br>
you and I cool down <br>
as they heat up<br>
it comes to you in a dream like that the phenomenal experience <br>
that is your life <br>
what I mean you get of it <br>
there it is there <br>
there it is there<br>
you saw the weather change and you were like that.<br>
so what
- where was you heart when you we slipping and falling<br>
how can i make love to myself if you're too restrictive with your definition of it, my love<br>
somethings coming <br>
somethings coming <br>
you'll never turn to it again, <br>
it's just a dream. <br>
not fearing the dark dark forest</p><br>

<p>
<br>
who knows but the same ways home </p><br>
