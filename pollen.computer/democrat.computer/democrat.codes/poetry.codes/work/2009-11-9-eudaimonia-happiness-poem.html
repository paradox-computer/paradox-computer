<p>
-will you come to me ?<br>
will you come ?<br>
will you follow through on what we saw today<br>
you heard the beat of a music that I thought was just for me <br>
I read it in your face, your hands moved with simple grace<br>
you could be a painter if be but a canvas where the air was there <br>
I can see that you are not in disrepair but something has wronged you <br>
And I would be but a hand away, <br>
hand in hand support you<br>
what will it be like when <br>
we differentiate our phenomenal experience,<br>
what will something new be like?<br>
something new but so like a dream<br>
I may know what it is like when I am not mine<br>
I know how to be you<br>
but what it will be like in the future, but what the experience will bring<br>
I can not Imagine and so now I only can await it like a gift from you<br>
you the listener who captivates me <br>
who unwinds the rhymes and sets backwards the motion of that which I constructed<br>
lay the pieces to the floor <br>
only you can find the one thing in them that can be carried on<br>
You will find the one seed that will flourish if you reach to it<br>
Eudaimonia </p><br>

<p>
I would take the first ship out of harbor <br>
I would catch the first train from the station<br>
-or a taxi off any road as far as my money would take me<br>
or overseas if it were to take me further <br>
But I can't Go!<br>
I can't leave,<br>
&nbsp; Something in this city on a hill is held captive <br>
I know it captivated me <br>
&nbsp; It was like the garden, and it cannot be uprooted <br>
&nbsp; we can not get back to what is gone<br>
We cannot get back to something which is not there<br>
we can not but symbolize life that is not. </p><br>
